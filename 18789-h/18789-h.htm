<h1>SWIRLING WATERS</h1>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE WHIRLPOOL</span></h2>


<p>On the crucial night of his career, 14 March,
191-, Clifford Matheson, financier, was
speeding in a taxi-cab to the Gare de Lyon.</p>

<p>He was a clean-limbed man of thirty-seven.
There was usually a look of masterfulness in the
firm lines of his face, the straight, direct glance,
the stiff, close-cut moustache. But to-night his
eyes were tired, very tired. He leant back in a
corner of the cab with drooping shoulders as though
utterly world-weary.</p>

<p>At the station his wife and father-in-law were
looking impatiently for his arrival. They stood
at the door of their <i>wagon-lit</i> in the C&ocirc;te d'Azur
Rapide, searching the crowded platform for him.
It was now ten to eight, and the express was timed
to pull out of the Gare de Lyon at eight o'clock
sharp.</p>

<p>"Late again!" growled Sir Francis Letchmere.
"Clifford makes a deuced casual sort of husband.
Bad form, you know!"</p>

<p>Good form and bad form were the foot-rules by
which he measured mankind.</p>

<p>Olive bit her lip. It galled her pride that Clifford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
should not be early on the platform to see to her
comforts. The attentions of her father and maid
did not satisfy her; she wanted Clifford to be there
to fetch and carry for her.</p>

<p>Pride was the keynote of her character. It was
pride and not love that had decided her, five years
before, to marry the financier. She had admired the
way in which he had slashed out for himself his
place in the world of London and Paris finance,
from his humble beginning as a clerk in a Montreal
broker's office. It ministered to her pride to be
the wife of a man who had plucked success from
the whirlpool of life. As to the methods by which
he had amassed his money, with these she was
not concerned. She knew, of course, that there
were many who had bitter things to say about
his methods.</p>

<p>"Probably it's his brother who's delayed him,"
said Olive, looking for an explanation which would
salve her <i>amour propre</i>. "They both seem to be
crazy over their rubbishy scientific experiments."</p>

<p>"Who's this brother?"</p>

<p>"I know scarcely anything about him. His
name's Rivi&egrave;re&mdash;he's a half-brother. He turns
up unexpectedly from the wilds of Canada, and
lives like a hermit, so Clifford tells me, in some
tumbledown villa outside Paris."</p>

<p>"What's he like?"</p>

<p>"I've never seen him."</p>

<p>"What's the scientific experiment?"</p>

<p>"Clifford told me something about it, but I forgot.
I wasn't interested in the slightest. No money
in it, I could see at once. I told Clifford so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Francis tugged at his watch impatiently.
"He'll miss this train for certain!"</p>

<p>"No; there he is!"</p>

<p>Matheson was striding rapidly through the press
of people on the platform. He quickly caught
sight of his wife and father-in-law, and came up
with a gesture of apology.</p>

<p>"Sorry I'm so late. Very sorry, too, I shan't
be able to travel with you to-night."</p>

<p>"Experiment to finish?" queried Olive, with
an unconcealed note of contempt in her voice.</p>

<p>"A very important business engagement for
this evening. Will you excuse me? I can follow
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Can't it wait?"</p>

<p>"It's highly important."</p>

<p>"There's the 'phone to speak over."</p>

<p>"I have to come face to face with my man.
Surely, Olive, you can spare me for a day? Have
you everything you want for the journey?"</p>

<p>"Who is the man?"</p>

<p>"Lars Larssen," answered Matheson. He lowered
his voice slightly, though on the bustling railway
platform there was no likelihood of anyone listening
to the conversation.</p>

<p>Sir Francis nodded his head. He was heavily
interested in company-promoting himself, as a
means of swelling an inadequate property income,
and Lars Larssen was a magic name.</p>

<p>"Hudson Bay scheme?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, business before pleasure," he remarked
sententiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive cut in with a question. "Have you
finished your experiments with your brother?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Matheson evenly.</p>

<p>"When will they be finished?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. There's a great deal to be discussed
and planned."</p>

<p>"Then bring him with you to-morrow. You
can plan together whatever it is you have to plan
at Monte. Besides, I want to see him."</p>

<p>"John is a busy man," protested Matheson.
"I don't think he can leave his laboratory."</p>

<p>"Give him my invitation, and make it a
pressing one," pursued Olive, careless of anything
but her own whim. "Tell him&mdash;tell him I particularly
want him to explain his experiments to me
himself."</p>

<p>At this moment the little horn of departure
sounded its quaint note from the end of the platform,
and a porter hurried to lock the door of the
<i>wagon-lit</i>.</p>

<p>"Have you everything you want for the
journey?" asked Matheson.</p>

<p>"I have everything I want," replied his wife
coldly. "My father has seen to that.... Good-bye."</p>

<p>She did not offer to kiss him, and he for his part
drew back into a shell of reserve. Many thoughts
were buzzing through his mind as they exchanged
the commonplaces of a railway station good-bye
from either side of a compartment window.</p>

<p>Olive's last words were: "Remember, I'm
expecting you to bring your brother with you
to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>A very tired look was in Matheson's eyes, and
a weary droop on his shoulders, as the train pulled
out and he was left alone on the platform.</p>

<p>Two Frenchmen whispered to one another about
him. "The milord Matheson, see you! The very
rich milord Matheson."</p>

<p>"Ah, if I were only a rich man too!"</p>

<p>"What would you do?"</p>

<p>"I should <i>spend</i>. How I should spend!" He
licked his lips at the thought of the pleasures of
body that money could buy him.</p>

<p>"I should <i>save</i>," said the other. "I should
make myself the richest man in the world. That
would be glorious!"</p>

<p>These last words reached the ears of Matheson,
and set up a curious train of thought as he drove
in his cab to his office in the Rue Laffitte. The
words carried him back to a forest-clearing in the
backwoods of Ontario, where he and his half-brother
had made holiday camp some eighteen years before.
They were comparing ambitions&mdash;two young men
unusually alike in features but very different in
temperament and will-power. John Rivi&egrave;re, the
elder of the two, was dreaming of fame in the paths
of science&mdash;he had worked his way through M'Gill
University and was hoping for a demonstratorship
to keep him in living expenses. Clifford
Matheson, a clerk in a broker's office, planned his
life in terms of cities and money. "To make big
money&mdash;that's what I call success."</p>

<p>In the rapids of the stream by their feet was a
swirl of waters covering a sunken rock, and Rivi&egrave;re
had thrown on to it a chip of wood. The chip was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
whirled round and round, nearer and nearer to
the centre, until finally it was sucked under with
a sudden extinguishment.</p>

<p>"There's the life you plan," he had said to
Clifford....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">A &pound;5,000,000 DEAL</span></h2>


<p>When Matheson reached his office, he
was told by a clerk that Mr Lars Larssen
was already waiting to see him. He
threw off his gloves and fur-lined coat and adjusted
the lights before he answered that his visitor could
be shown in. He added that the clerk could lock
up his own rooms and leave, as he would not be
wanted any longer that evening.</p>

<p>There was a quiet simplicity in Matheson's office
that one would scarcely associate with the operations
of high finance. One might have looked
for costly furnishings and an atmosphere redolent
of big money. Yet here was a simple rosewood
desk with a bowl of mimosa on it, and around the
walls were a few simple landscapes from recent
<i>salons</i>.</p>

<p>If Lars Larssen were a magic name to Sir Francis
Letchmere, it was a magic name also to many
other men of affairs. From cabin-boy to millionaire
shipowner was his story in brief. But that does
not tell one quarter. The son of Scandinavian
immigrants to the States, factory-workers, he had
run away to sea at the age of fourteen, with the
call of the ocean ringing in his ears from the Viking
inheritance that was his. But on this was super<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>posed
the fierce desire for success that formed the
psychical atmosphere of the new American environment.
As a boy in the smoke-blackened
factory town, he had breathed in the longing to
make money&mdash;big money&mdash;to use men to his own
ends, to be a master of masters.</p>

<p>With precocious insight he quickly learnt that
money is made not by those who go out upon the
waters, but by those who stay on land and send
them hither and thither. He soon gave up the
seafaring life and entered a shipbroker's office.
He starved himself in order to save money to
speculate in shipping reinsurance. An uncanny
insight had guided him to rush in when shrewdly
prudent business men held aloof.</p>

<p>He had emphatically "made good." Each fresh
success had given him new confidence in himself
and his judgment and his powers. He would
allow nothing to stand in his path. Scruples
were to him the burden of fools.</p>

<p>A fair-haired giant in build, with inscrutable
eyes and mouth set grim and straight&mdash;such was
Lars Larssen.</p>

<p>Though Matheson was in no way a small
man, yet he seemed somehow dwarfed when
Larssen entered the room. The financier was
a self-made master, but the shipowner was a <i>born</i>
master of men&mdash;perhaps one's instinctive contrast
lay there. The one had the strength of finished
steel, but the other was rugged granite.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen said quietly: "Your letter brought
me over to Paris. I don't usually waste time in
railway trains myself when I have men I can pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to do it for me. So you can judge that I consider
your letter mighty important."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if you have given yourself an unnecessary
journey," returned Matheson. "I had
intended my letter to make my attitude clear to
you."</p>

<p>"Then you missed fire."</p>

<p>"My attitude is simply this: I want to call the
deal off."</p>

<p>"Not enough in it for you?" cut in Larssen.</p>

<p>"Not enough in it for the public."</p>

<p>The shipowner surveyed the other man through
half-closed lids, weighing up how far this declaration
might be a genuine expression of opinion and
how far a mere excuse to cover some hidden motive.</p>

<p>"Talk it longer," he said.</p>

<p>For reply Matheson drew out a large-scale map
of Canada from a drawer and unfolded it with a
decisive deliberation. He laid a finger on the
south-western corner of Hudson Bay. "Here is
Fanning trading station, the terminus of your
five-hundred-mile railway. The land you run it
over is mostly lakes, rivers, and frozen swamps
for three-quarters of the year. The line is useless
except for your own purpose&mdash;to carry wheat for
the Hudson Bay steamship route to England.
You agree?"</p>

<p>"Agreed." Larssen was not the man to waste
argument over minor points when a vital matter
was under discussion.</p>

<p>"Then the scheme centres on the practicability
of making the arctic Hudson Bay passage a commercial
highway. It means the creating of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
modern port at Fanning. It means the lighting of a
whole coast-line"&mdash;his finger travelled to the north
of Hudson Bay and the northern coast of Labrador&mdash;"before
a cargo of wheat leaves Port Fanning."</p>

<p>"I'll build lighthouses myself by the dozen if
the Canadian Government won't. I'll equip every
one with long-range wireless."</p>

<p>"The cost will be tremendous."</p>

<p>"There will be a differential of sixpence a bushel
on wheat over my route. That talks down fifty
lighthouses."</p>

<p>"But it makes no allowance for rate-cutting
by the big men on the present routes. Further,
if the Canadian Government are not with you on
this scheme, they'll be against you. There are
a dozen ways in which you might be frozen out.
In that case the Hudson Bay Route will be the
biggest fiasco that ever happened."</p>

<p>"Nothing I've yet touched has been a fiasco,"
answered Lars Larssen with a grim tightening of
jaw. "Leave that end to me.... Now your
end is to get the money."</p>

<p>"From the English and Canadian public."</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"You came to me because the English and
Canadian public are prejudiced against 'Yankee
propositions.' You yourself couldn't float it in
England. On the other hand, I'm Canadian-born,
and my name carries weight both in England and
in Canada."</p>

<p>"With the public," added Larssen, and there
was a subtle emphasis on the word "public," which
carried a world of hidden meaning. Matheson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
had been associated with other schemes which
had a bad odour in the nostrils of City men.</p>

<p>"With the public who provide the capital,"
answered the financier, and his emphasis was on
the word "capital." He continued. "With myself
and Sir Francis Letchmere and a few titled
dummies on the Board&mdash;which is what you want
from me&mdash;the public will tumble over one another
to take up stock."</p>

<p>"Agreed."</p>

<p>"The capitalization you propose is &pound;5,000,000
in Ordinary &pound;1 Shares, which the public will mostly
take up. Also &pound;200,000 in Deferred Shares of the
nominal value of one shilling each, which are to be
allotted to yourself as vendor. That gives you
four million votes out of a total of nine million,
and for practical purposes means control."</p>

<p>"The Deferred Shares are not to get a cent of
dividend until a fifteen per cent. dividend is paid
on the Ordinary Shares. That's the squarest deal
for the public that ever was," retorted Larssen.</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> hold <i>control</i>."</p>

<p>Both men knew the tremendous import of that
word. The fortunes of the world's financial giants
have all been built up on "control." Dwarfing
"capital" and "credit" it stands&mdash;that word
"control." If the wild gamble of the Hudson
Bay scheme were to rush through to commercial
success&mdash;if the limitless wheat-lands of Canada
were to pour their mighty torrent of life into Europe
through the channel of Hudson Bay&mdash;it would be
Lars Larssen who would hold the key of the sluice-gate.
Directly, he would be master of the wheat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of Canada. Indirectly, he could turn his master-position
to financial gain in scores of ways. The
&pound;200,000 to be allotted him as vendor was a bagatelle;
but to hold four million votes out of nine
million was to control an empire.</p>

<p>He replied evenly: "I keep control on any
proposition I touch. That's creed with me.
<i>Creed.</i>"</p>

<p>"We split on that," answered Matheson.</p>

<p>"You want control for yourself?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then what is it you do want?"</p>

<p>"I want half the Deferred Shares in the hands
of Lord &mdash;&mdash;." He named a Canadian statesman
and empire-builder whose integrity was beyond
all suspicion. "I want him to hold them as trustee
for the ordinary shareholders. He will consent
if I ask him."</p>

<p>"No doubt he will!" commented Larssen
ironically. He drew up his chair closer to the
other man. There was a dangerous gleam in his
eye as he said: "Now see here. All the points
you've put up were known to you months ago.
What's happened to make you switch at the last
moment?"</p>

<p>He had put his finger on the very core of the
matter, but Matheson met his searching gaze
without flinching. "What's happened is an
entirely private matter. I've reasons for not
wishing to be associated with your scheme unless
you agree to half the Deferred Shares being held
by Lord &mdash;&mdash; as trustee. These reasons of mine
have only arisen during the last few weeks. Cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>cumstances
are different with me from what they
were when you first broached the plan. If you
don't care to agree to my suggestion, I call the
deal off. As regards the expenses you've incurred,
I'll go halves."</p>

<p>For comment, the shipowner flicked thumb and
forefinger together.</p>

<p>"No, I'll do more," pursued Matheson. "I'll
make you a more than fair offer&mdash;shoulder the
whole expenses myself."</p>

<p>Larssen ignored the offer. "I went into the
preliminaries of the scheme on the understanding
that we were to pull together."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"It means big money for you&mdash;enough to retire
on."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Then what the hell's the reason for this sudden
attack of scruples?"</p>

<p>For a moment Matheson's eyes blazed black
anger, but the anger died out of them and the
tired look of the platform of the Gare de Lyon
took its place. "You wouldn't understand," he
answered. "The whirlpool."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"It would be useless to explain. I have private
reasons.... I've made you a thoroughly fair
offer, and I don't think there's anything more to
be said." Matheson rose and walked to the window,
pulling up the blind and gazing out on the sombre
splendour of the big banking houses of the Rue
Laffitte and the Rue Pillet-Will.</p>

<p>Larssen looked at the silhouette of his anta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>gonist
with a tense set of his jaws. Many plans
were revolving in his mind. Moralists might have
labelled them "blackmail," but Lars Larssen was
utterly free from scruples where his own interests
were concerned. Honesty with him was a mere
matter of policy. To a man with the average
sense of honour, such an attitude of mind is scarcely
realisable, but Lars Larssen was no normal man.
In him the Napoleonic madness&mdash;or genius&mdash;burned
fiercely. He had ambitions colossal in
scale&mdash;he regarded his present wealth and power
as a mere stepping-stone to the realisation of his
Great Idea.</p>

<p>That great ultimate purpose of his life he had
never revealed to man or woman&mdash;save only to
his dead wife. He aimed to be controlling owner
of the world's carrying trade; to hold decision
on peace and war between nation and nation
because of that control of the vital food supply.
To be Emperor of the Seven Seas.</p>

<p>He had one child only&mdash;his boy Olaf, now aged
twelve, at school in the States. Olaf was to hold the
seat of power after him and perpetuate his dynasty.</p>

<p>That was Larssen's life-dream.</p>

<p>Any man or woman who stood between him and
his great goal was to be thrust aside or used as a
stepping-stone. Matheson, for instance&mdash;he was
to be <i>used</i>. There must be something underlying
Matheson's sudden access of scruples&mdash;what was
it? A case of <i>cherchez la femme</i>? Or political
ambitions, perhaps? If he could arrive at the
motive, it might open up a new avenue for persuasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>He searched the silhouette of the man at the
window for an answer to the riddle. But Matheson's
face was set, and the answer to the riddle
was such as Lars Larssen could never have guessed.
It lay outside the shipowner's pale of thought&mdash;beyond
the limitations of his mind.</p>

<p>For Matheson also had his big life-scheme, and
it now filled his mind with a blaze of light as he
stood by the window, silent.</p>

<p>Larssen resolved to play for time while he set
to work to ferret out his antagonist's motive for
the sudden change of plan. He did not dream
for a moment of relinquishing control on the Hudson
Bay scheme. As he had stated openly, control
was <i>creed</i> to him.</p>

<p>He broke the long silence with a conciliatory
remark. "Let's think matters over for a day or
two. My scheme might be modified on the financial
side. I'm prepared to make concessions to what
you think is fair to the shareholders. We shall
find some common ground of agreement."</p>

<p>The smooth words did not deceive Matheson.
So his answer came with deliberate finality: "I've
said my last word."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll consider it carefully. Meanwhile,
doing anything to-night? I hear that Polaire
is on at the Folies Berg&egrave;res with her opium-den
scene. A thriller, I'm told."</p>

<p>Theatres and music-halls were nothing to the
shipowner; his idea was to keep Matheson under
observation if possible, and try to solve the riddle.</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I've got to get away from Paris,"
answered Matheson with his tired droop of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
shoulders. "I have to join my wife and father-in-law
at Monte Carlo."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I'll say good-bye for the
present."</p>

<p>When Larssen had left the office, he hurried
into a taxi and was whirled to the Grand Hotel
near at hand. Here he found his secretary turning
over the illustrated papers in the hall lounge,
and gave a few curt directions. "Drive round
to the Rue Laffitte&mdash;a hurry case. On the second
floor of No. 8 is the office of Clifford Matheson.
He may be still there&mdash;you'll know by the light
in the window. Wait till he comes out, and follow
him. Find out where he goes. If it's to a woman's
house&mdash;good. In any case shadow him to-night
wherever he goes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">SHADOWED</span></h2>


<p>Matheson, alone in his office, thought
deeply for a long while, pacing to and
fro, grappling with a life-decision. To
and fro, from door to windows, from windows to
door, he paced, until the narrow confines of the
office thrust at him subconsciously and drove him
to the open streets.</p>

<p>At his desk he made out a cheque in favour of
Lars Larssen to the amount of twenty thousand
pounds, enclosed it with a brief note in an addressed
envelope, and put it away in a drawer.
It was shortly after eleven when he took up his
hat, fur-lined coat and heavy gold-mounted stick,
clicked out the lights, and made his way down
to the Rue Laffitte.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Rue Laffitte he passed a
young man lounging in the shadows, who presently
turned and followed him at a sober distance.
Matheson made up towards the heights of Montmartre,
crowned by the white Basilique of the
Sacred Heart. The great church stood out in cold
white beauty&mdash;serene and pure&mdash;above the feverish
glitter of Paris. Up there a man might attune
himself to the message of the stars&mdash;might weigh
duty against duty in the balance of the infinite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked deep in thought, with shoulders
drooping.</p>

<p>Beyond the clamorous glitter of the Place Pigalle,
with its garish entertainment halls and all-night
restaurants, there is a dark, narrow, winding lane
ascending steeply to the great white sentinel church
on the heights. Up this Matheson strode, still
deep in thought, and his shadower followed. But,
half-way up, a new factor cut sharply into the
situation. Out of a <i>ruelle</i> crept two <i>apaches</i> with
the stealthy glide of their class. One followed
close behind Clifford Matheson, while the other
stopped to watch the lane against the possible
arrival of an <i>agent de police</i>.</p>

<p>The young man who had followed from the Rue
Laffitte paused irresolute. On the one hand were
his orders to shadow Matheson wherever he might
go that night; on the other hand was his personal
safety. He was keenly alive to the merciless
ferocity of the Parisian <i>apache</i>, and he was unarmed.
The wicked curved knife doubtless concealed
under the belt of the <i>apache</i> turned the
scale decisively in the mind of the shadower. He
saw no call to risk his own life.</p>

<p>He gave up and retraced his steps, leaving
Matheson to his fate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">ON THE SCENT OF A MYSTERY</span></h2>


<p>The name of the young man who had
shadowed Matheson was Arthur Dean, and
his position in life was that of a clerk in
the Leadenhall Street office of Lars Larssen. The
latter had brought him over to Paris as temporary
secretary because the confidential secretary had
happened to be ill and away from business at the
moment when Matheson's letter arrived.</p>

<p>Young Dean bitterly repented his cowardice
before he was five minutes distant from the narrow
lane on the heights of Montmartre.</p>

<p>Not only had he left a fellow-countryman to
possible violence and robbery, but his action would
inevitably recoil on himself. To be even a temporary
secretary to the great shipowner was a
chance, an opportunity that most young business
men of twenty-four would eagerly grasp at. He
was throwing away his chance by this cowardly
disobedience to orders&mdash;Lars Larssen was not the
man to forgive an offence of that kind.</p>

<p>Dean turned on his tracks and again crossed
the Place Pigalle. The lane behind was deserted.
He mounted it and searched eagerly. His search
was fruitless. Matheson was nowhere visible&mdash;nor
the two <i>apaches</i>. To what had happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in that interval of ten minutes there was no
clue.</p>

<p>The young fellow did not dare to go back to the
Grand Hotel and report his failure. He wandered
about aimlessly and miserably, until a flaunting
poster outside an all-night <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i> caught
his eye and decided him to enter and kill time
until some plan for retrieving his failure might
occur to him.</p>

<p>As he entered the swinging doors a cheery hand
was laid on his shoulders. "Hullo, old man!
Hail and thrice hail!"</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" There was a note of pleasure in
the young man's voice.</p>

<p>"The same," confirmed Jimmy Martin. He
was a tubby, clean-shaven, rosy-faced little fellow
of thirty odd, with an inexhaustible fund of good
spirits. Everyone called him "Jimmy." Dean
had known him as a reporter on a London daily
paper and a fellow-member of a local dramatic
society in Streatham.</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" asked Dean.</p>

<p>"Strictly on business, my gay young spark.
My present owners, the <i>Europe Chronicle</i>, bless
their dear hearts, want to know if La Belle
Ariola"&mdash;he waved his hand towards a poster
which showed chiefly a toreador hat, a pair
of flashing eyes, and a whirl of white draperies&mdash;"is
engaged or no to the Prince of Sardinia.
I find the maiden coy, not to say secretive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish you could help me," interrupted Dean
eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"If four francs seventy will do it&mdash;my worldly
possessions until next pay-day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, this is quite different." He drew
Martin outside into the street and whispered.
"To-night, as I happen to know, an Englishman
walking along a back street by the Place Pigalle
was followed by two <i>apaches</i>."</p>

<p>"A week-end tripper, or somebody with a
flourish at each end of his name?"</p>

<p>"Somebody worth while. Now I want to know
particularly if anything happened."</p>

<p>Martin nodded in full understanding. "Come
along to the office about ten to-morrow morning,
and I'll tell you if anything's been fired in from
the <i>gendarmeries</i> or the hospitals. What did you
say the man's name was?"</p>

<p>Dean shook his head.</p>

<p>"Imitaciong oyster?" commented Martin cheerfully.
"Very well, see you to-morrow. Meanwhile,
be good. Flee the giddy lure. Go home
to your little bed and sleep sweet." There
was seriousness under his good-natured banter.
"Come along and I'll see you as far as the bullyvards."</p>

<p>Arthur Dean went with him, but did not return
to the Grand Hotel. He found a small hotel for
the night, and next morning at ten o'clock he was
at the office of the <i>Europe Chronicle</i>, an important
daily paper published simultaneously in Paris,
Frankfort, and Florence.</p>

<p>Martin came out from the news room into the
adjoining ante-room with a slip of "flimsy" in
his hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was your man hefty with the shillelagh?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"He carried a big, gold-mounted stick."</p>

<p>"Then here's your bird." He read out from
the slip of paper: "Last night, shortly after
twelve, a certain Gaspard P&mdash;&mdash; was brought to
the H&ocirc;pital Malesherbes suffering from a fractured
skull. This morning, on recovering consciousness,
he states that he was attacked without cause
by a drunken Englishman, and struck over the
head with a heavy stick. His state is grave."</p>

<p>Dean felt a warm wave of relief. He thanked
the journalist cordially and was about to leave,
when the telephone bell rang sharply in the adjoining
news room. The sub-editor in charge
took up the receiver.</p>

<p>"<i>Ullo, ullo! C'est ici le Chronicle</i>," said the
sub-editor, and after listening for a moment signed
imperatively to Martin to come in and shut the
door.</p>

<p>Presently Martin came out from the news room
bustling with energy and took Dean by the arm.
"You specified two <i>apaches</i>, didn't you?" he
asked, and hurried on without waiting for an
answer. "One was probably the injured innocence
now at the Malesherbes and cursing those
<i>sacr&eacute;s Angliches</i>, but the other lies low and says
nuffink. That's the one that interests me. Come
along in my taxi and watch me chase a story."</p>

<p>Stopping only to borrow fifty francs for expenses
from the cashier's wicket, Martin hurried his friend
into a taximeter cab and gave the brief direction:
"Pont de Neuilly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour later they had reached
the bridge at the end of the long avenue of
the suburb of Neuilly and had dismissed the
cab.</p>

<p>"Now for our imitaciong Sherlock Holmes,"
said Martin. "The 'phone message was that a
man had found a fur coat and a gold-mounted stick
under some bushes by the left bank of the Seine
four hundred metres down stream. He was apparently
some sort of workman, and explained
that he had no wish to be mixed up with the police.
On the other hand, he felt he had to do his duty
by the civilization that provides him with a blue
blouse, bread, and bock, so he 'phoned the news
to us.... Wish everyone was as sensible," he
added, viewing the matter from a professional standpoint.</p>

<p>Three hundred yards down, they began to look
very carefully amongst the bushes that line the
water's edge. It was not long before they came
to the object of their search. Under an alder-bush
they found it&mdash;a heavy fur-lined coat sodden
with the river water, and a gold-mounted stick.</p>

<p>The maker's name had been cut out of the overcoat;
its pockets were empty.</p>

<p>Martin held it up. "Did this belong to your
man?" he asked, as though sure of the answer.</p>

<p>"No," answered Dean decisively.</p>

<p>The journalist whisked around in complete surprise
and looked at him keenly. "<i>Sure?</i>"</p>

<p>"Positive. There was astrakhan on the collar
and cuffs of the coat my man was wearing."</p>

<p>"And this stick?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"It looks much the same kind, but then there
are thousands of sticks like this in use."</p>

<p>The stout little journalist looked pathetically
disappointed. For the moment he had no thought
beyond the professional aspect of the matter&mdash;the
unearthing of a "good story"&mdash;and the human
significance of what he had found was entirely
out of mind. He turned over the coat and stick
in obvious perplexity, as though they ought somehow
to contain the key to the puzzle if only he
could see it. Then he examined the traces of
footsteps on the damp earth by the water-side.
There was another set of footprints beside their own&mdash;no
doubt the footprints of the man who had
first found the objects and 'phoned to the <i>Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do next?" asked the
young clerk.</p>

<p>"Take them to the police?"</p>

<p>Martin looked up and down the river bank.
That part of the Seine is usually deserted except
for nursemaids and children and an occasional
workman. At the moment there was apparently
no one in sight.</p>

<p>"You don't know the Paris police&mdash;that's
evident," returned the journalist. "They would
throw fits on the floor if I were so much as to carry
off a coat-button. No, we must hide the coat
and stick in the bushes again, and tell them
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-four hours' start is due to my owners,
bless their sensational little hearts. If nothing
further comes to light, then the press steps aside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and allows the law to take its course. Meanwhile
to the Morgue and the Malesherbes. We'll pick
up a cab on the Avenue de Neuilly. Newspaper
life, my young friend, is one dam taxi after another."</p>

<p>The Morgue is, of course, no longer the public
peep-show that it used to be, but Martin's card
procured him instant admission. On the inclined
marble slabs, down which ice water gently trickles,
were two ghastly white figures of women which
had been waiting identification for some days.
The object of their search was not at the Morgue.</p>

<p>They proceeded across Paris to the H&ocirc;pital
Malesherbes, but at the Place de l'Opera Dean
asked to be put down. The journalist promised
to 'phone to the Grand Hotel if anything of interest
came to light, and Arthur Dean went to
make his report to Lars Larssen. It was already
past mid-day, and without doubt the shipowner
would be impatient to hear news.</p>

<p>Only stopping at a telephone call office for a
few minutes, Dean hurried to his employer's suite
of rooms.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Lars Larssen.</p>

<p>"To begin at the beginning, sir, I waited last
night in the Rue Laffitte until Mr Matheson came
out of his office. It was not long before he appeared,
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shipowner interrupted curtly. "I want
the heart of the matter."</p>

<p>Dean gulped and answered: "I believe Mr
Matheson has been murdered."</p>

<p>"Believe! Do you <i>know</i>?"</p>

<p>"Of course I don't know for certain, sir; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
this morning I assisted at the finding of his coat
and stick on the banks of the Seine."</p>

<p>"Sure they were his?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite sure. I was with a journalist friend
of mine, but I didn't let him know that I recognized
the coat and stick. I thought perhaps you would
like me to tell you before the matter was made
public."</p>

<p>"Good! Now give me the full story."</p>

<p>Arthur Dean summoned up his nerve to tell the
connected tale he had thought out during the long
cab rides that morning. It was essential that he
should disguise his cowardice and his failure to
carry out orders of the night before. With that
exception, his account was a truthful and detailed
story of all that had happened. He concluded
with:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I 'phoned up Mr Matheson's office&mdash;without
telling my name&mdash;and asked if he was in or had
been to the office this morning. They said no.
I got his hotel address from them and 'phoned
the hotel. They also could tell me nothing about
Mr Matheson."</p>

<p>Lars Larssen paced the room in silence for some
time. Finally he shot out a question.</p>

<p>"Your salary is?"</p>

<p>"&pound;100 a year, sir."</p>

<p>"Engaged, or likely to be?"</p>

<p>The young man blushed deeply as he replied:
"I hope to be shortly."</p>

<p>"You can't marry on two pound a week."</p>

<p>"I am hoping to get promotion in the office,
and then&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you understand how to get promotion?"</p>

<p>"Of course, sir. I intend to work hard and study
the details of the business outside my own department,
and learn Spanish as well as French&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lars Larssen flicked thumb and finger together
contemptuously. "The men I pay real money
to are not that kind of men."</p>

<p>Arthur Dean looked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Now see here," pursued the shipowner, fixing
his eyes deep into the young man's, "why did you
lie to me just now?"</p>

<p>Dean went deathly white, and began to falter
a denial.</p>

<p>"Don't lie any further! Something happened
last night that you haven't told me of. I know,
because you brought in no report last night. Out
with it!"</p>

<p>Under that merciless look the young clerk made
a clean breast of the matter. His voice shook
as he realized that it probably meant instant dismissal
for him. Here was the end of all his hopes.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen made no comment until the last
details had been faltered out. Then he said
abruptly: "I propose to raise you &pound;300 a year."</p>

<p>Dean stared at him in silent amazement.</p>

<p>"&pound;300 a year is good salary for a young man.
If I pay it, I want it earned. Now understand
this: what I want in my men is absolute loyalty,
absolute obedience to orders, and absolute truthfulness
to me. Lie to others if you like&mdash;that's
no concern of mine&mdash;but not to me. Further,
understand what orders mean. If I tell you to
do a thing, I am wholly responsible for its outcome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
The responsibility is not yours&mdash;it's mine. Got
that?"</p>

<p>"It's very generous of you to give me such a
chance, sir. It's much more than I have the right
to expect. You can count on my loyalty and
obedience to the utmost&mdash;of course, provided
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The men I want to raise in my employ, and
the men I have raised, leave fine scruples to me.
That's my end. Your end is to carry out orders.
If you're going to set store on niceties of truthfulness
when business interests demand otherwise,
you'll remain a two-pound-a-week clerk all your
life."</p>

<p>Dean's weakness of moral fibre had been shrewdly
weighed up by Larssen. The young man was
plastic clay to be moulded by a firm grasp. &pound;300
a year opened out to him a vista of roseate possibilities.
&pound;300 a year was his price.</p>

<p>The colour came and went in his face as he
thought out the meaning of what his employer
had just said. At length he answered: "I owe
you many thanks, sir. What do you want me
to do?"</p>

<p>"Understand this: &pound;300 a year is your starting
salary. If I find you after trial to be the man I
think you are, you can look forward to bigger
money.... Now my point lies here; Mr Matheson
was engaged with me in a large-scale enterprise.
Alive, he would have been useful to me. I intend
to keep him alive!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE FIRST MOVE IN THE GAME</span></h2>


<p>At the great Leadenhall Street office of the
shipowner, an office which bore outside
the simple sign&mdash;ostentatious in its simplicity&mdash;of
"Lars Larssen&mdash;Shipping," Arthur
Dean had looked upon his employer from afar as
some demi-god raised above other business men
by mysterious gifts from heaven. A modern
Midas with the power of turning what he touched
to gold.</p>

<p>Now he was granted an intimate glimpse into
the workings of his employer's mind that came
to him as a positive revelation. Larssen's were
no mysterious powers, but the powers that every
man possessed worked at white heat and with an
extraordinary swiftness and exactitude. The
revelation did not sweep away the glamour; on
the contrary, it increased it. Lars Larssen was
a craftsman taking up the commonest tools of his
craft and using them to create a work of art of
consummate build.</p>

<p>His present work was to keep alive the personality
of Clifford Matheson until the Hudson
Bay scheme should be launched. To use Matheson's
name on the prospectus, and to use his influence
with Sir Francis Letchmere and others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Dead, Matheson was to serve him better than
alive.</p>

<p>But the shipowner did not build his edifice on the
foundation merely of what Arthur Dean had told
him. He had to satisfy himself more accurately.</p>

<p>A string of rapid, apparently unconnected orders
almost bewildered the young secretary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, get a list of the big hotels at Monte Carlo.
Engage the trunk telephone and call up each
hotel until you find where Sir Francis Letchmere
is staying. Give no name.... Buy a pair of
workman's boots to fit you. Get them in some
side street shop. Bring them with you&mdash;don't
ask them to send.... Take this typewriting"&mdash;he
took a letter from his pocket and carefully
clipped off a small portion&mdash;"and match it with
a portable travelling machine. Can you recognize
the make of machine off-hand?"</p>

<p>Dean examined the portion of typed matter,
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"You must train yourself to observe detail.
Looks to me like the type on a 'Thor' machine.
Try the Thor Co. first. If not there, go to every
typewriter firm in Paris until it matches.... Go
to the offices of the Compagnie Transatlantique
and get a list of sailings on the Cherbourg-Quebec
route. Give no name.... Meanwhile, 'phone
your journalist friend and have him call on
me."</p>

<p>"What reason shall I give him, sir?"</p>

<p>"Anything that will pull him here. Tell him
I'm willing to be interviewed on the proposed
international agreement about maritime contra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>band
in time of war. Quite sure you remember
all my orders?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sir."</p>

<p>"Repeat them."</p>

<p>The young man did so.</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>Dean flushed with pleasure at the commendation.</p>

<p>"Had lunch yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>Lars Larssen smiled as he said: "Well, postpone
lunch till to-night, or eat while you're hustling
around in cabs. This is a hurry case. Here's
an advance fifty pounds to keep you in expense
money."</p>

<p>As the crisp notes were put into his hand, Arthur
Dean felt that he was indeed on the ladder which
led to business status and wealth. His thoughts
went out to a little girl in Streatham who was
waiting, he knew, till he could ask her to be his
wife. If Daisy could see how he was being taken
into his employer's confidence!</p>

<p>Lars Larssen startled him with a remark that
savoured of thought-reading. "My three-hundred-a-year
men," he said, "don't write home about
business matters."</p>

<p>"I quite understand, sir."</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, Jimmy Martin of the
<i>Europe Chronicle</i> sent in his card at the Grand
Hotel, and Lars Larssen did not keep him waiting
beyond a few moments.</p>

<p>The tubby little journalist was no hero-worshipper.
Few journalists can be&mdash;they see too
intimately the strings which work the affairs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the world for the edification of a trustful public.
Consequently, Martin's attitude in the presence
of the millionaire shipowner was as free from constraint
or subservience as it would be in the dressing-room
of La Belle Ariola, who danced the bolero
at a <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i>, or in the ward of the Malesherbes
H&ocirc;pital, interviewing an <i>apache</i> with a cracked
skull.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen summed him up with lightning
rapidity of thought, and adjusted his own attitude
to a friendly, confidential basis.</p>

<p>Said Martin: "You want to talk about contraband
of war? I'd better tell you the <i>Chronicle</i>'s
red-hot against the olive-branch merchants, so
I hope you're not one of them. Say you agree
with us, and I can spread you over half a column."</p>

<p>The shipowner smiled. "That's the talk I
like. Make a policy and set the buzzer going.
Now see here...."</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour he had established
a link of easy friendship, and had brought the conversation
round without difficulty to the matter
which was the real object of the interview.</p>

<p>"Dean was telling me about the help you gave
him on his wild-goose chase to-day. Many thanks.
He's a steady young fellow and will get on&mdash;but
a little too ready to jump at conclusions. Of
course you found nothing at the hospital?"</p>

<p>On the answer much depended, but no one could
have guessed it from the shipowner's face, which
was smilingly confident.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing!" answered Martin. "Our
young friend with the cracked skull met the holy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Tartar last night. He's raving sore&mdash;wants to
prosecute him for assault, if he can find out who
he is."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But there's a disappointment in
store for him. I met my friend to-day going off
to Canada. What are you going to do about the
coat and stick at Neuilly?"</p>

<p>"Hunt around for a few more clues before turning
it over to the police." There was a tired
disappointment in the journalist's voice that Lars
Larssen noted with keen satisfaction. "I doubt
if the police'll do much unless the relations kick
up a shindy. Paris is the finest place in Europe
to get murdered in peacefully and without a lot
of silly fuss. You see, it might be a hoax. Your
Parisian hoaxer likes a dash of Grand Guignol
horrors in his jokelet. The police have been had
several times, and they're very much hoax-shy. I
could tell you some pretty tales about mysterious
disappearances that never get into the papers."</p>

<p>A little later the journalist took his departure.
As the great shipowner shook hands at the door,
he said cordially: "If you want news from me
when I'm in Paris any time, come straight to me.
I like your paper; I like your methods."</p>

<p>Martin left without a suspicion that he had been
"pumped" for vital information.</p>

<p>Now the shipowner had to wait patiently for
nightfall before the first definite move of his game
could be played. One of his secrets of success
was that he never allowed his mind to worry him.
He shut the matter completely out of his conscious
thoughts; got a trunk telephone call to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
London office; sent off some cables to his New
York office; and generally immersed himself on
business matters quite unrelated to the Matheson
case.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock that night before Arthur
Dean returned from an errand on which he had
been sent. In his arms was a bulky brown-paper
parcel.</p>

<p>He opened it in the privacy of his employer's
sitting-room, and remembering the advice given
him that morning as to the way to present a
business report, pointed silently to a small slit
in the side of the fur-lined coat, where it would
cover a man's ribs. On the inner lining of the coat
there was a dark stain around the slit, though the
immersion in the river had of course washed away
any definite blood-clot.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen nodded appreciation of the young
fellow's method of going straight to the heart of
the subject. "Good!" said he. "Now for
details."</p>

<p>"I carried out your orders exactly, sir. Took
a cab to Neuilly, dismissed it, put on the pair of
workman's boots when I was in the darkness of
the river bank, and found the coat and stick just
where Martin and I had hidden them in the bushes.
The trees make it quite dark along that part of the
Seine, and I am certain no one saw me taking
them and wrapping them in my brown paper.
The coat was nearly dry."</p>

<p>"Did you find the stick broken?"</p>

<p>"No. I broke it in two so that it could be
wrapped in the same parcel as the coat."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you examine footprints?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The only ones around the bushes were
Martin's and mine made this morning, and the
prints of the man who first discovered them. Of
course my own prints this time were made by the
boots you told me to buy and put on."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"I went along the river bank for a couple of
miles with my parcel until I came to some other
suburb, and then I caught a cab to the Arc de
Triomphe, and there I took another cab to here."</p>

<p>"The workman's boots?"</p>

<p>"After I changed back to my ordinary boots,
I threw them in the river, as you told me to."</p>

<p>"They sank?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else worth reporting, I think....
Do you recognize this coat and stick as belonging
to Mr Matheson, sir?"</p>

<p>Lars Larssen nodded non-committally, and
ordered the young fellow to get a trunk telephone
call through to Sir Francis Letchmere at Monte
Carlo. Dean had already found out that he was
staying at the Hotel des Hesp&eacute;rides.</p>

<p>But when the telephone connexion had been
made, it was Olive who answered from the other
end of the wire:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is Mrs Matheson. Who is speaking?"</p>

<p>"Mr Larssen. I want Sir Francis Letchmere."</p>

<p>"He's out just now. Shall I take your
message?"</p>

<p>"Have you heard yet from your husband?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"He's off to Canada. I thought he would have
wired you."</p>

<p>"That's just like Clifford!" There was an
angry sharpness in the voice over the wire.</p>

<p>"I reckon he was in too much of a hurry. It's
in connexion with the Hudson Bay scheme&mdash;you
know about that?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Has anything gone wrong with it?"
Now there was anxiety in the voice.</p>

<p>"A new situation has arisen. Your husband
suggested to me that he had better hurry across
the pond and straighten up matters." Larssen
lowered his voice. "Somebody in the Canadian
Government wants oiling. Of course he will have
to work the affair very quietly."</p>

<p>"It's too annoying! Clifford had promised me
faithfully to come on to Monte by to-night's
train. I wanted him here."</p>

<p>"That's rough on you!"</p>

<p>"What message did you wish to give to my
father?"</p>

<p>"About the Hudson Bay deal. I want to meet
Sir Francis and talk business."</p>

<p>"You're not going to drag him back to Paris!"</p>

<p>Again there was annoyance in her voice, and
Lars Larssen made a quick resolution. He
answered: "Certainly not, if you don't wish it.
Rather than that, I'll come myself to Monte."</p>

<p>"That's charming of you!"</p>

<p>"The least I can do. I'll wire later when to
expect me."</p>

<p>"Many thanks."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>When the conversation had concluded, the shipowner
called the young secretary and asked him
to bring in the new "Thor" travelling typewriter
he had purchased that afternoon. Larssen had
proved right in his guess of the make of machine
with which his scrap of typing had been done.</p>

<p>"Take a letter. Envelope first," said Larssen.</p>

<p>"You want me to take it direct on the machine,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The shipowner began to dictate.
"Monsieur G. R. Coulter, Rue Laffitte, 8, Paris....
Now for the letter.... Cherbourg, March
15th."</p>

<p>"Any address above Cherbourg?"</p>

<p>"Not at present. 'Cherbourg, March 15th.
Dear Coulter, I am called away to Canada on
business. The matter is very private, and I want
my trip kept very quiet. I leave affairs in your
hands until my return. Get my luggage from my
hotel and keep it in the office. If anything urgent
arises, my name and address will be Arthur Dean,
Hotel Ritz-Carlton, Montreal.'"</p>

<p>The young secretary went white, and his fingers
dropped from the keys of the typewriter.</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>It was a moment of crisis.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Lars Larssen sharply.</p>

<p>"A letter like that, sir...!"</p>

<p>"You don't care to go to Canada?"</p>

<p>"It's not that, but&mdash;&mdash;" He stammered,
and stopped short.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen allowed a moment of silence to give
weight to his coming words. He drew out a cheque-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>book
from his breast-pocket and very deliberately
said: "Make yourself out a cheque for a usual
month's wages, and bring it to me to sign. That
will be in lieu of notice."</p>

<p>Arthur Dean took the cheque-book with shaking
fingers and went to the adjoining room.</p>

<p>When at length he came back, he found the shipowner
making out a telegram. He stood in silence
until the telegram was given into his hand, open,
with an order to send it off to London. His glance
fell involuntarily on the writing, and he could see
that the wire was to call over somebody to replace
him.</p>

<p>"I don't think this will be necessary, sir," said
Dean, with a tremor in his voice which told of the
mental struggle he had been through in the adjoining
room, when his career lay staked on the
issue of a single decision.</p>

<p>It was not without definite purpose that Lars
Larssen had put the cheque-book into his hands.
He knew well the power of suggestion, and used
it with a master-hand. He could almost see the
young secretary torn between the thoughts of a
miserable &pound;8 on the one hand, and the illimitable
wealth suggested by a blank cheque-book on the
other.</p>

<p>"Understand this," answered Larssen. "Whichever
way you decide matters nothing to me from
the business point of view. I can get a dozen,
twenty men to replace you at a moment's notice.
If you don't care to go to Canada, you're perfectly
free to say so. Then we part, because you're
useless to me. Aside from the purely business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
point of view, I should be sorry. I like you; I
see possibilities in you; I could help you up the
business ladder."</p>

<p>"That's very good of you, sir."</p>

<p>"Wait. I want you to see this matter in the
proper light. You have an idea that what that
letter represents could get you into trouble with
the law. That's it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Dean coloured.</p>

<p>"Now see here. I stand behind that letter.
My reputation is worth about ten thousand times
yours in hard cash. Would I be mad enough to
risk my reputation unless I had looked at every
move on the board?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that at the time."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Now you see the other side of the
picture. If you want half an hour to make up
your mind once and for all, take it. Consider
carefully what you'd like to be in the future:
clerk or business man. Two pound a week; or
six, ten, twenty, fifty a week. That represents
the difference between the clerk and the business
man in cold cash."</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind, sir," answered Dean
firmly.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lars Larssen, and held out his
hand to his young employee. "There's the right
stuff in you!"</p>

<p>To have his hand shaken in friendship by the
millionaire shipowner was as strong wine to Arthur
Dean. He flushed with pleasure as he stammered
out his thanks.</p>

<p>A couple of hours packed with feverish activity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
followed. Lars Larssen knew that Clifford Matheson
had the habit of carrying a small typewriter
with him on his journeys, in order to get through
correspondence while on trains and steamers.
Many busy men carry them. This habit of Matheson's
was exceedingly useful for his present purpose.
The letter that Arthur Dean was to post
off at Cherbourg&mdash;one to the Paris office of Clifford
Matheson and one of similar purport to the London
office&mdash;would only need the signature in holograph.
Larssen had several of Matheson's signatures
on various letters that had passed between them,
and these he cut off and gave to his employee to
copy.</p>

<p>He criticised the spacing and the general lay-out
of the letter already typed, showed Dean how to
imitate Matheson's little habits of typing, and
arranged that the letters dictated should be retyped
on hotel paper at Cherbourg and posted
there. Dean was to catch a night train to Cherbourg,
take steamer ticket there for Quebec, and
proceed to Montreal. There were a host of directions
as to his conduct while in Canada, and
as Larssen poured out a stream of detailed
orders, searching into every cranny and crevice
of the situation, the young clerk felt once more
the glamour of the master-mind.</p>

<p>Here was an employer worth working for!</p>

<p>Early next morning Dean was at grimy Cherbourg,
and after posting off his letters he sent the
following telegram to Mrs Matheson at Monte
Carlo:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sailing this morning for Canada on 'La Bre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>tagne.'
Urgent and very private business.
Larssen, Grand Hotel, Paris, will explain. Sailing
as Arthur Dean to avoid Canadian reporters.
Good-bye. Much love."</p>

<p>As the liner lay by the quayside with smoke
pouring from her funnels and the bustle of near
departure on her decks, a telegram in reply was
brought to Arthur Dean. He opened and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most annoying. Cannot understand why
business could not have been given to somebody
else. However, expect nothing from you nowadays.
Where is Rivi&egrave;re? Not arrived, and no
line from him."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re? Who was this man? Lars Larssen
had made no mention of this name. It was the
one facet of the situation of which the shipowner
knew nothing&mdash;the one unknown link in the chain
of circumstance.</p>

<p>Arthur Dean could only send a frantic wire to
Lars Larssen, and the liner had cast off from her
moorings before an answer came. This is what
the shipowner found awaiting him at his hotel:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs M. wants to know where is Rivi&egrave;re. Reply
urgent. Who is Rivi&egrave;re?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LIFE</span></h2>


<p>On the morning of March 15th, Clifford
Matheson lit a blazing fire in the laboratory
of a tumbledown villa in Neuilly in order
to destroy the clothes and other identity marks
of the financier.</p>

<p>For some months past he had been leading a double
life&mdash;as Clifford Matheson the financier, and as
John Rivi&egrave;re the recluse scientist. He had chosen
to take up the name of his dead half-brother because
he had been taking up the latter's life-work.</p>

<p>The motives that had urged him to this strange
double life were such as a Lars Larssen could
scarcely comprehend. Every man has his mental
as well as his physical limitations. The keenest
brain, if trained on some specialized line, will fail
to understand what to the dabbler in many lines
seems perfectly natural and reasonable. Larssen,
a master-mind, had his peculiar limitations as well
as smaller men. His brain had been trained to
see the world as an ant-heap into which some
Power External had stamped an iron heel. The
ants fought blindly with one another to reach the
surface&mdash;to live. That was the law of life as he
saw it&mdash;to fight one's way to the open.</p>

<p>The world he looked upon breathed in money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
through eager nostrils. Money was the oxygen
of civilization. Without money a man slowly
asphyxiated. It must be every man's ambition
to own big money&mdash;to breathe it in himself with
full-lunged, lustful, intoxicating gulps, and to dole
it out as master to dependents pleading for their
ration of life. That was the meaning of power:
to give or withhold the essentials of life at one's
pleasure.</p>

<p>Consequently he had failed to read the riddle
of Matheson's motive at that crucial interview in
the financier's office on the Rue Laffitte. He had
failed to realize that a man might be as eager to
give as to grasp. He had failed to reckon on
altruism as a possible dominating factor in the
decisions of a successful man of business.</p>

<p>Further than that, it lay entirely outside Lars
Larssen's plane of thought that a man who had
fought his way up to worldly success from a clerk's
stool in a Montreal broker's office, who had made
himself a power in the world of London and Paris
finance, could voluntarily give up money and
power and bury himself in obscurity.</p>

<p>Larssen judged that Matheson had been murdered
and robbed by the <i>apaches</i>. It was possible,
though extremely improbable, that he might have
committed suicide. Which it was, mattered nothing
to the shipowner. But he did not dream
for one instant that Matheson might have thrown
up place and power to disappear into voluntary
exile.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Clifford Matheson had set himself from the age<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of eighteen to achieve a money success. At thirty-seven,
he had achieved it. He had slashed out
for himself a path to power in the financial world.
He was rich enough to satisfy the desires of most
men.</p>

<p>Five years ago he had married into a well-known
English family, and the doors of society had been
opened wide to him. But his marriage had been
a ghastly mistake. Olive, after marriage, had
showed herself entirely out of sympathy with the
idealism that formed so large a part of the complex
character of her husband. She wanted money
and power, and she drove spurs into her husband
that he might obtain for her more and more money,
more and more power. Any other ambition in
Clifford she tried to sneer down with the ruthlessness
of an utterly mercenary woman.</p>

<p>He had come to loathe the sensuous artificiality
of his life. He had come to loathe the ruthless
selfishness of finance. He was sick with the
callousness of that stratum of the world in which
he moved.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years he had found himself
drawn powerfully towards the calm, passionless
atmosphere of science in which his elder brother,
John Rivi&egrave;re, had found his life-work. Rivi&egrave;re
had made no worldly success for himself. The
scientific researches he had undertaken made no
stir when they found light in the pages of obscure
quarterlies circulating amongst a few dozen other
men engaged in similar research. Rivi&egrave;re had
not the temperament to push himself or the children
of his brain. He had settled into a solitary bachelor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
life in a small Canadian college&mdash;an unknown,
unrecognized man&mdash;and yet the calm, steady
purpose and the calm, passionless happiness of the
life had made a deep impression on Clifford Matheson.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re had come to an accidental death on a
holiday with his brother in the wilds of northern
Canada. Few knew of it beyond Matheson.</p>

<p>The financier had been drawn towards one special
problem of science, and on this he had studied
deeply the last few years. From his studies, an
idea had developed which could only be worked
out by experiments. Many years of patient research
would be needed, for this thought-child
of Matheson's was a master-idea, an idea which
meant the exploring of a practically uncharted
sea of knowledge.</p>

<p>In brief, it was an attack of root-problem of
human disease. Doctors and pathologists had
hitherto been viewing disease from the aspect of
its myriad effects on the highly complex human
being. It was as though one were to attempt
to understand the subtleties of some full-grown
language without first learning its elementary
grammar&mdash;the foundations on which its super-structure
is reared.</p>

<p>Now Matheson, coming to the problem with a
strong, fresh mind unhampered by the swaddling
clothes of a college training, saw it from a view-point
entirely different to that of the doctors.
He wanted to know the elementary grammar of
human disease. He found that no book dealt
with it&mdash;nor attempted to deal with it. No recognized
department of a medical course took as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
its province the root-causes of disease. Pathology
was a study of effects. Bacteriology&mdash;that
again was merely a study of effects.</p>

<p>He had read widely amongst a variety of scientific
research-matter, and had found that here and
there an isolated attack was being made on the
problem of causes. But nothing strong-planned&mdash;as
any one of his financial schemes would be
planned&mdash;nothing co-ordinated. The researches
of the day were starting at points too complex,
before the basic conditions of the problem were
known.</p>

<p>He wanted to learn, and to give to the world,
the basic facts.</p>

<p>Disease, as he viewed it, was primarily the result
of abnormal conditions of living. His idea was to
study it in its simplest possible form. To study
the effects of abnormal conditions of life on the
lowest living organisms&mdash;the microscopic blobs
of life whose structure is elemental. From his
wide reading of the last couple of years, he knew
what little was already known and the vast field
that was unexplored territory. He need not waste
time over what others had already dealt with&mdash;the
new territory offered sufficient field for a life-work.</p>

<p>Once he could get at the basic facts of disease
as it related to the very simplest organisms, he
could progress upwards to the higher organisms,
and so eventually to man. What could be learnt
from the pathological condition of an am&oelig;ba
might lay the foundations for the conquering of
cancer in man, and a hundred other diseases as well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Matheson's idea was a revolutionary one&mdash;a
master-idea like a master-patent. It held limitless
possibilities for the alleviation of human pain
and suffering.</p>

<p>It was an idea to which a man might well devote
his whole intellect and energies.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some months before, the financier had bought,
in the name of John Rivi&egrave;re, a tumbledown villa
on the outskirts of Neuilly. In it he had fitted up
a research laboratory in which to pursue the experimental
end of the problem which had such
vital interest for him.</p>

<p>A high wall surrounded a garden overgrown
with weeds and a villa falling to decay. At one
time, no doubt, the house had formed a nest for
the <i>petite amie</i> of some rich Parisian, but now the
owner of the property was only too glad to sell
it at any price, and without asking any but the
most perfunctory questions of the man who had
offered to buy. In the solitude of the ruined
villa, Matheson had been pursuing his scientific
research at such times as he could snatch from his
financial business. He had been leading a "double
life"&mdash;from a motive far different to the double
life of other married men. There was no woman
in the case. There was no secret scheme of money-making.
There was no solitary pandering to the
senses with drink or drugs.</p>

<p>But the financier had been finding that the
leading of a double life bristled with practical
difficulties. Apart from the calls of his business,
there were the insistent demands of his wife. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
position was becoming an intolerable one. He
had to choose between the life of the money-maker
or that of the creator of a new field of knowledge.</p>

<p>On the night of 14th March the conversation
on the platform of the Gare de Lyon and the fight
with Lars Larssen had brought the question of
decision to a head. He had grappled with it in
his office, pacing to and fro long after the shipowner
had left. He had turned his steps towards
the heights of Montmartre so that he might carry
his problem up to the solitude of a high place, in
the peace of the eternal stars.</p>

<p>He was deep in the question of decision when
the two apaches had attacked him in the narrow
lane leading to the Basilique of the Sacred Heart.
Matheson was a man of considerable strength and
alertness. He had felled one of the two <i>apaches</i>
with his heavy gold-mounted stick; the other
one had sent through the fur-lined coat a knife-thrust
which had grazed his ribs. Matheson had
beaten him off, and had then continued his path
to the Basilique.</p>

<p>But the attack had brought a vivid inspiration
for the solution of his personal problem.</p>

<p>He would slip off the personality of Clifford
Matheson and take up completely that of John
Rivi&egrave;re. He would leave his overcoat and stick
by the riverside at Neuilly, and 'phone information
about them to the police or to a newspaper. That
knife-slit in his overcoat would be taken as evidence
of murder. They would judge him murdered,
with robbery as motive. The courts would give
leave for Olive to presume death. She would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
freed; she would come into her husband's fortune;
she could marry again if she chose to.</p>

<p>Surely that was the solution of his personal
problem!</p>

<p>For his part he could live his life unshackled,
and there was sufficient money already standing
in the name of Rivi&egrave;re at a Paris bank to give him
a modest income on which to keep himself and
pay for the materials of research.</p>

<p>No one would be the worse for his disappearance;
his wife would be the gainer; and mankind, he
hoped, would be the gainer through the research
to which he could henceforth devote his life.</p>

<p>Yes, that was assuredly <i>the</i> solution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">A SEAT BY THE ARENA</span></h2>


<p>Rivi&egrave;re had bought fresh clothes and
other necessities at the suburban shops
of Neuilly. He had shaved off his moustache;
arranged his hair differently; put on a
new shape of collar. It is curious how the shape
of a collar is associated in most minds with the
impression of a man's features. To change into
another shape is to make a very noticeable difference
to one's appearance.</p>

<p>He had also bought travelling necessities. His
intention was to wander for a couple of months.
It would help him to clear his brain from the tangle
of financial matters which still obsessed it against
his will. He wanted to sweep out the Hudson
Bay scheme, Lars Larssen, Olive, and many other
matters from the living-room of his mind. He
wanted a couple of months in which to settle himself
in the new personality; plan out his future
work in detail; set the mental fly-wheel turning,
so as to concentrate his energies undividedly on
the work to come.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, old Mme Dromet entered the
villa to scrub and clean. She had a standing
arrangement to come two or three afternoons a
week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going away from Paris?" shouted
old Mme Dromet to her employer, seeing the portmanteau
and the other signs of departure. She
was stone-deaf, and in the manner of deaf people
always shouted what she had to say.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re nodded assent, and produced a paper
of written instructions. These he read through
with her, so as to make sure that she thoroughly
understood. Then he gave her a generous allowance
to cover the next few months.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, he was seated with his
modest travelling equipment in a cab, driving to
No. 8, Rue Laffitte. He mounted to the offices
of the financier and, in order to test the efficacy
of his changed appearance, asked to see Mr Clifford
Matheson.</p>

<p>For a moment the clerk stared at the visitor.
The resemblance to his employer was certainly
very striking. Yet there were differences. Mr
Matheson wore a close-cut moustache, while this
man was clean-shaven. The commanding look,
the hard-set mask of the financier were softened
away; there was joy of life, there was freedom
of soul in the features and in the attitude of this
visitor.</p>

<p>"I am Mr John Rivi&egrave;re, his half-brother. Will
you tell him that I am here?"</p>

<p>The clerk felt somehow relieved. That of course
explained the striking resemblance. He replied:
"Mr Matheson has not been at the office to-day,
sir. I fancy he has left for Monte Carlo. I am
not sure, but I believe that was his intention."</p>

<p>"Has he left no message for me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will see, sir. Please take a seat."</p>

<p>Presently the clerk returned. "I am sorry,
sir, but there doesn't seem to be any message left
for you."</p>

<p>"Tell him I called," said Rivi&egrave;re, and went
back to his cab. In it he was driven to the Gare
de Lyon. At the booking-office he asked for a
ticket for Arles. His intention was to travel
amongst the old cities of Provence, and then make
his way to the Pyrenees and into Spain. There
was no definite plan of journey; he wanted only
some atmosphere which would help him to clear
his mind for the work to come. In the Midi the
early Spring would be breathing new life over the
earth.</p>

<p>About midnight the southern express stopped
at some big station. The rhythmic sway and
clatter of a moving train had given place to a
comparative stillness that awoke John Rivi&egrave;re
from sleep. He murmured "Dijon," and composed
himself to a fresh position for rest. Some
hours later there was again a stoppage, and instinctively
he murmured "Lyon-Perrache." The
phases of the journey along the main P.L.M. route
had been burnt into him from the visits with Olive
to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>In the morning the strange land of Provence
opened out under mist which presently cleared
away beneath the steady drive of the sun. The
low hills that border the valley of the Rhone
cantered past him&mdash;quaint, treeless hills here
scarped and sun-scorched, there covered with
low balsam shrubs. Now and again they passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a straggling white village roofed with big, curved,
sun-mellowed tiles. Around the village there would
be a few trees, and on these the early Spring of
the Midi had laid her fingers in tender caress.</p>

<p>The air was keen and yet strangely soft; to
Rivi&egrave;re it was wine of life. He drew it in thirstily;
let the wind of the train blow his hair as it listed;
watched greedily the ever-changing landscape. The
strange bare beauty of this land of sunshine and
romance brought him a keen thrill of happiness.</p>

<p>It was as though he had loosed himself from
prison chains and had emerged into a new life of
freedom.</p>

<p>In full morning they reached Arles, the old
Roman city in the delta of the Rhone. It clusters,
huddles around the stately Roman arena on the
hill in the centre of the town&mdash;a place of narrow,
tortuous <i>ruelles</i> where every stone cries out a
message from the past. In the lanes, going about
the business of the day, were women and girls
moulded in the strange dark beauty of the district&mdash;the
"belles Arl&eacute;siennes" famous in prose and
verse.</p>

<p>Yet chiefly it was the arena that fascinated
him. All through the afternoon he wandered
about the great stone tiers, flooded in sunlight,
and reconstructed for himself a picture of the days
when gladiators down below had striven with one
another for success&mdash;or death. The arena was
the archetype of civilized life.</p>

<p>Now he was a spectator, one of the multitude
who look on. It was good to sit in the flooding
sunlight and know that he was no longer a gladiator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in the arena. There was higher work for him to
do, away from the merciless stabbing sword and
the cunning of net and trident.</p>

<p>At intervals during the afternoon a few tourists&mdash;mostly
Americans&mdash;rushed up in high-powered,
panting cars to the gateway of the arena; gave
a hurried ten minutes to the interior; and then
whirled away across the white roads of the Rhone
delta in a scurry of dust.</p>

<p>Only one visitor seemed to realize, like himself,
the glamour of the past and to steep the mind in
it. This was a woman. Her age was perhaps
twenty-five, in her bearing was that subtle, scarcely
definable, sureness of self which marks off womanhood
from girlhood. She climbed from tier to
tier of the amphitheatre with firm confident step;
stood gazing down on her dream pictures of the
scene in the arena; moved on to a fresh vantage-point.
She wore a short tailored skirt which ignored
the ugly, skin-tight convention of the current
fashion. Her cheeks were fresh with a healthy
English colour; her eyes were deep blue, toning
almost to violet; her hair was burnished chestnut
under the soft felt hat curled upwards in front;
a faint odour of healthy womanhood formed as
it were an aura around her.</p>

<p>All this John Rivi&egrave;re had noticed subconsciously
as she passed close by him on the ledge
where he sat, walking with her firm, confident step.
Though he noted it appreciatively, yet it disturbed
him. He did not want to notice any woman.
He had big work to do, and on that he wanted to
concentrate all his faculties. He had had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
thought of a woman in his life when he broke the
chains that shackled him to the Clifford Matheson
existence. He purposed to have no call of sex
to divert him from the realization of his big idea.</p>

<p>Presently she had climbed to the topmost ledge
of the amphitheatre, and stood out against the
sky-line of the sunset-to-be, deep-chested, straight,
clean-limbed, a very perfect figure of a modern
Diana.</p>

<p>It is a dangerous place on which to stand, that
topmost ledge of the amphitheatre, with no parapet
and a sheer drop to the street below. Almost
against his will, Rivi&egrave;re mounted there.</p>

<p>But there was no occasion for his help, and they
two stood there, some yards apart, silent, watching
the red ball of the sun sink down into the limitless
flats of the Camargue, and the grey mist rising
from the marshes to wrap its ghostly fingers round
this city of the ghostly past.</p>

<p>Twice she looked towards him as though she
must speak out the thoughts conjured up by this
splendid scene. It wanted only some tiny excuse
of convention to bridge over the silence between
them, but Rivi&egrave;re on his side would not seek it,
and the woman hesitated to ask him to take up
the thread that lay waiting to his hand.</p>

<p>A cold wind sprang up, and she descended and
made her way to her hotel on the Place du Forum.</p>

<p>At dinner in the deserted dining-room of his
hotel, Rivi&egrave;re found himself seated at the next
table to her. There are only two hotels worthy
of the name in Arles, and the coincidence of
meeting again was of the very slightest. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
somehow he felt subconsciously that the arm of
Fate was bringing their two lives together, and he
resented it.</p>

<p>The silence between them remained unbroken.</p>

<p>In the evening he wrapped himself in a cloak
against the bitter wind rushing down the valley
of the Rhone and spreading itself as an invisible
fan across the delta, and wandered about the dark
alleys of the town, twisting like rabbit-burrows,
lighted only here and there with a stray lamp
socketed to a stone wall. Now he had left the big-thoughted
age of the Romans, and was carried
forward to the crafty, treacherous Middle Ages.
In such an alley as this, bravos had lurked with
daggers ready to thrust between the shoulder-blades
of their victims. Now he was in a wider
lane through which an army had swept pell-mell
to slay and sack, while from the overhanging
windows above desperate men and women shot
wildly in fruitless resistance. Now he was in
another of the lightless rabbit-burrows....</p>

<p>A sudden sharp cry of fear cut out like a whip-lash
into the blackness. A woman's cry. There
were sounds of angry struggle as Rivi&egrave;re made
swiftly to the aid of that woman who cried out
in fear.</p>

<p>Stumbling round a corner of the twisting alley,
he came to where a gleam from a shuttered window
showed a slatted glimpse of a woman struggling
in the arms of a lean, wiry peasant of the Camargue.
Rivi&egrave;re seized him by the collar and shook him
off as one shakes a dog from the midst of a fray.
The man loosed his grip of the woman, and snarl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>ing
like a dog, writhed himself free of Rivi&egrave;re.
Then, whipping out a knife from his belt, he struck
again and again. Rivi&egrave;re tried to ward with his
left arm, but one blow of the knife went past the
guard and ripped his cheek from forehead to jawbone.</p>

<p>At that moment a shutter thrown open shot
as it were a search-light into the blackness of the
alley, full on to the man with the knife, and Rivi&egrave;re,
putting his whole strength into the blow, sent a
smashing right-hander straight into the face of
his adversary. Thrown back against the alley-wall,
the man rebounded forward, and fell, a
huddled, nerveless mass, on the ground.</p>

<p>From doorways near men came out with lights ... there
was a hubbub of noise ... excited
questions eddied around Rivi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>But the latter made no answer. He turned to
find the woman who had been attacked.</p>

<p>"Mr Rivi&egrave;re!"</p>

<p>It was the woman who had stood by him on the
topmost ledge of the amphitheatre, drinking in
that glorious fiery sunset over the grey Camargue.
She was flushed, but very straight and erect.</p>

<p>"That brute was attacking me. Oh, if only
I had had some weapon!" Then she noticed
the blood dripping from the gash in his forehead,
and cried out: "You're hurt! Take this."</p>

<p>Her handkerchief was pressed into his hand.
He answered as he took it: "It's nothing. Fortunately
it missed the eye. And you?"</p>

<p>"I'm not hurt, thanks. Oh, you were splendid!
It makes one feel proud to be an Englishwoman."</p>

<p>"Come to the hotel," he said, and ignoring the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
excited questioning of the knot of men, took her
arm and led her rapidly to their hotel on the Place
du Forum.</p>

<p>"Let me dress your wound until the doctor
can come."</p>

<p>"I don't want a doctor," he replied coldly. A
sudden aloofness had come into his voice.</p>

<p>Her eye sought his with a piqued curiosity. For
a moment, forgetting that here was a man who
had rescued her from insult at considerable bodily
risk, she saw him only as a man of curious, almost
boorish brusqueness. Why this sudden cold
reserve?</p>

<p>Then, with a reddening of cheek at her momentary
lapse from gratitude, she began to thank him
for his timely help.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re cut her short. "There is nothing to
thank me for. I didn't even know it was you.
I heard a woman's cry&mdash;that was all. You ought
not to go about these dark <i>ruelles</i> alone at night-time."</p>

<p>They were at the door of their hotel by now.</p>

<p>"Can't I dress the wound for you?" she asked.
"I've had practice in first aid, Mr Rivi&egrave;re."</p>

<p>He paused suddenly in the doorway and asked
her abruptly: "How do you know my name?"</p>

<p>"I know more than your name. When your
cut has been dressed, I'll explain in full."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I can manage quite well myself.
Let us meet again in the <i>salon</i> in, say, half
an hour's time."</p>

<p>They parted in the corridor and went to their
respective rooms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>When they met again, he had his head bound up
with swathes of linen. His face was white with
the loss of blood, and she gave a little cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"You were badly hurt!"</p>

<p>"No; merely a surface cut. But please tell
me what you know about me."</p>

<p>There was a quick change in her to a smiling
gaiety. The man was human again&mdash;he had at
all events a very human curiosity.</p>

<p>"The name was from the hotel register, naturally,"
she answered. "But I know also that you are on
your way to Monte Carlo, which certainly can't
come from the register."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re's face became coldly impassive as he
waited for her to explain further.</p>

<p>"You are a scientist," she continued slowly,
watching him to note the effect of her words.
"You are to meet a lady for the first time at
Monte Carlo. Yet she knows you by your first
name, John. You see that I know a good deal
about you."</p>

<p>She waited for him to question her further, but
he remained silent, deep in thought.</p>

<p>More than a little piqued that he would not
question further, she gave him abruptly the
solution of the riddle.</p>

<p>"Two nights ago I travelled here from Paris
in the same train with an Englishwoman and her
father. They took breakfast at the table near to
mine in the restaurant car, and I could scarcely
help overhearing what they were saying. They
chatted about you. Then I found your name in
the hotel register."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why did you look it up?" he challenged
abruptly.</p>

<p>She parried the question. "The name caught
my eye by accident. Naturally I was interested
by the coincidence."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re turned the conversation to the impersonal
subject of Arles and its Roman remains, and
soon after they said good-night.</p>

<p>"Shall I see you at breakfast?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," he answered.</p>

<p>As she moved out of the room, a splendidly
graceful figure radiating health and energy and
life full-tide, Rivi&egrave;re could not help following her
with his eyes. His innermost being thrilled
despite himself to the magic of her splendid womanhood.</p>

<p>It plucked at the strings of the primitive man
within him.</p>

<p>In his room that evening he took up the blood-drenched
handkerchief. In the corner was the
name "Elaine Verney." The name conveyed
nothing to him. He threw the handkerchief away,
and shut her from his thoughts. He wanted no
woman in this new life of his.</p>

<p>With the morning came a resolution to avoid
her altogether. He rose very early and took the
first train out of Arles.</p>

<p>It took him to N&icirc;mes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">WHO AND WHERE IS RIVI&Egrave;RE?</span></h2>


<p>"Who is Rivi&egrave;re?"</p>

<p>Here was a new factor in the situation.
Lars Larssen mentally docketed it as a
matter to be dealt with immediately. After sending
off a reply telegram to Cherbourg (which reached
the quayside too late and was afterwards returned
to him), the shipowner got a telephone call through
to Olive at the Hotel des Hesp&eacute;rides.</p>

<p>"This is Mr Larssen speaking. Are you Mrs
Matheson?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Good morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning. I called you up to say that
your husband has sailed for Canada on 'La
Bretagne.' I had a line from Cherbourg this
morning."</p>

<p>"So had I."</p>

<p>"I suppose he explained matters to you?"</p>

<p>"No, he referred me to you for explanations.
Just like Clifford!... What about Rivi&egrave;re&mdash;is he
coming to Monte?"</p>

<p>Lars Larssen had to tread warily here. So he
answered: "I didn't quite catch that name."</p>

<p>"John Rivi&egrave;re, my husband's half-brother. He
lives in some suburb of Paris, I forget where, and
Clifford was to bring him along to Monte."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The shipowner decided that he must find this man
and discover if he knew anything. The words of
Jimmy Martin flashed through his brain: "I doubt
if the police'll do much unless the relatives kick up
a shindy." Meanwhile, there was nothing to do
but tell the truth, which was his usual resource
when in an unforeseen difficulty.</p>

<p>"Don't know anything about him. If you give
me his Paris address I'll dig him out."</p>

<p>"We don't know his address."</p>

<p>"Then I'll find it at the office. As soon as I get
a line on him I'll wire you. Rivi&egrave;re? The name
sounds French."</p>

<p>"French-Canadian. He's a couple of years older
than Clifford, I believe.... When are you coming
yourself?"</p>

<p>"To-night's train or to-morrow. I'm not sure
if I can get away to-night."</p>

<p>"Do you play roulette?"</p>

<p>"No. Never been at the tables."</p>

<p>"Then I must teach you," said Olive gaily.</p>

<p>"Delighted!"</p>

<p>After the telephone conversation, Larssen went
straight to No. 8, Rue Laffitte. He had wired the
night before to London to have a secretary sent
over&mdash;Sylvester, his usual confidential man, if the
latter were back at business; if not, another subordinate
he named. Catching the nine o'clock
train from Charing Cross, the secretary would arrive
in Paris about five in the afternoon. Meanwhile,
Larssen, had to make his search for Rivi&egrave;re in
person.</p>

<p>The business of a financier differs radically from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a mercantile business on the point of staff. The
main work of negotiation can only be carried out
by the head of the firm himself, as a rule, and the
routine work for subordinates is small, except when
a public company flotation is being made. Matheson
had found that his Paris office needed only a manager,
Coulter, and a couple of clerks, one English and one
French. Coulter was a steady-going, reliable man
of forty odd, extremely trustworthy and not too
imaginative.</p>

<p>He knew Lars Larssen, of course, and received
him deferentially.</p>

<p>"What can I have the pleasure of doing for you,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I want the address of Mr John Rivi&egrave;re. Or
rather, Mrs Matheson wants it."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr John Rivi&egrave;re?"</p>

<p>This came as a fresh surprise to Lars Larssen, and
made him doubly anxious to discover the man. Why
all this mystery surrounding him?</p>

<p>"I understand from Mrs Matheson that Mr
Rivi&egrave;re is her husband's half-brother. Lives somewhere
around Paris."</p>

<p>"Strange! I've never heard of him myself.
I'll make enquiries if you'll wait a moment."</p>

<p>Presently Coulter returned with the young English
clerk of the office.</p>

<p>"It seems that Mr Rivi&egrave;re called here yesterday
afternoon and enquired for Mr Matheson," explained
Coulter.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen turned to the young clerk with a
questioning look. "It was the first time I had ever
seen him, sir," said the clerk. "He came in and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
asked quite naturally for Mr Matheson. There was
an astonishing likeness between them, but that was
explained at once when he told me they were half-brothers."</p>

<p>"An astonishing likeness?"</p>

<p>"When I say a likeness, sir, I mean of course in
a general way. Mr Rivi&egrave;re is younger and different
in many ways."</p>

<p>"Describe him."</p>

<p>The clerk did so to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>"Did he leave an address?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Or a message?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or say where he was going?"</p>

<p>The clerk could offer no clue to the whereabouts
or intentions of John Rivi&egrave;re. Repeated questioning
added little to the meagre information already given.</p>

<p>"Mr Matheson has not been at the office to-day
or yesterday. Have you seen anything of him?"
asked Coulter of the shipowner.</p>

<p>"I know. He's away to Canada."</p>

<p>"To Canada!"</p>

<p>"Yes. We discussed the matter the night I was
here. Hasn't he written you?"</p>

<p>"We've heard nothing."</p>

<p>"Reckon you will to-day.... Say, couldn't you
look in Mr Matheson's desk to find the address of
this Mr Rivi&egrave;re?"</p>

<p>Coulter was the financier's confidential man. He
had full power to go over his employer's desk except
for certain drawers labelled "Private," and he did
so now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>When he came back from the search, he had an
envelope in his hand addressed "Lars Larssen,
Esq."</p>

<p>"All I could find was this envelope for you, sir.
There seems to be no record of Mr Rivi&egrave;re's address."</p>

<p>The shipowner slit open the letter and read it
with a countenance that gave no clue whatever to
what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p>"My dear Larssen," it ran, "I estimate your
expenses on the Hudson Bay scheme at roughly
&pound;20,000, and I enclose cheque for that amount. If
this is right, please let me have a formal receipt and
quittance. I want you to understand that my
decision on the matter is final. I regret that I am
obliged to back out at the last moment, but no
doubt you will be able to proceed without my help."</p>

<p>The letter was in handwriting, and had not been
press-copied. Larssen noted that point at once with
satisfaction. But the letter itself gave him uneasiness.
It explained nothing of Matheson's motives.
From the 'phone conversation with Olive, it was
clear that she had no suspicion that her husband
wanted to withdraw from the Hudson Bay deal.
In fact, she had asked anxiously if anything had
gone wrong with the scheme. Sir Francis Letchmere
might of course be closer in Matheson's business
confidence, and that was one of the reasons for
travelling to Monte Carlo and talking to him face
to face.</p>

<p>But with his keen intuitive sense, Lars Larssen
felt that the explanation was in some way connected
with this mysterious John Rivi&egrave;re. It was
imperative to get in touch with the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Where was Rivi&egrave;re? Was there nobody who could
throw light on his whereabouts? His jaw tightened
as he began to chew on the problem. Paris is too
big a city in which to hunt for a mere name.</p>

<p>After thanking the manager, Larssen withdrew
from the room. Passing through the outer office,
he was addressed by the other of the two clerks, a
young Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said he in French, "here is a point
which perhaps will be of service. I am at the
window when Monsieur Rivi&egrave;re arrives <i>en taxi-auto</i>.
On the <i>imp&eacute;riale</i> I see a portmanteau. Doubtless
Monsieur Rivi&egrave;re journeys away from Paris."</p>

<p>"Did you note the number of the cab?"</p>

<p>The young Frenchman made a gesture of sympathetic
negation. There had been no reason to
look at the number, even if he could have read it
from a window on the second story.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Larssen, but the information
seemed at first sight valueless. A man takes an
unknown cab from an unknown house in an unknown
suburb to an unknown terminus, when he
buys a ticket for an unknown destination. Sheer
waste of energy to hunt for a needle in that
haystack!</p>

<p>Yet his bulldog mind would not let go of the
problem. Presently he had found a new avenue
of approach to it. If Rivi&egrave;re had travelled away
from Paris on the evening of the 15th, probably he
stayed that night or the next day at some hotel.
There he would have to fill in his name, etc., in the
hotel register according to the strict requirements
of the French law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Advertise in the papers for one John Rivi&egrave;re from
Paris, age thirty-seven, staying at a hotel in the
provinces on the 15th or 16th. Offer a reward for
information. The average Frenchman is very keen
on money; without a doubt he would answer the
advertisement if he knew anything of John Rivi&egrave;re.
Advertise in <i>Le Petit Journal</i>, <i>Le Petit Parisien</i> and
a few other dailies which cover France from end to
end, as no English or American journals do in their
respective countries.</p>

<p>That was the right solution!</p>

<p>Larssen did not pay the cheque for &pound;20,000 into
his bank. He was after big game, and a mere
&pound;20,000 was a jack-rabbit. It would be safer, he
felt, to let it lie amongst his secret papers.</p>

<p>When Sylvester, his private secretary, arrived
by the afternoon train from London, Lars Larssen
placed him in touch with only so much of the
situation as he considered desirable. This was
little. Sylvester was to stay in Paris while the
shipowner went on to Monte Carlo. If the various
advertisements brought a reply, Sylvester was to
hunt out John Rivi&egrave;re in whatever part of France
he might be, and then communicate with Lars
Larssen for further orders.</p>

<p>The secretary was a quiet, self-contained, silent
man of thirty or thirty-one. A heavy dark
moustache curtained expression from his lips.
Not only could he carry out orders to the letter, but
he was to be trusted to keep his head in any unforeseen
emergency and act on his own responsibility
in a sound, common-sense way. But Lars
Larssen trusted no man beyond the essentials of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
any situation. His was the brain to plan and
direct. He preferred obedient tools to brilliant,
independent helpers.</p>

<p>At the train-side, Larssen gave a final direction
to his subordinate: "Keep me in touch with every
move."</p>

<p>Back at his hotel, Sylvester occupied himself with
the development of some films he had taken on the
Channel passage. In his hours of leisure he was a
devoted amateur photographer. At the present
time there was nothing to be done but wait the
possible answer to the advertisement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">AT MONTE CARLO</span></h2>


<p>Next day, the wonderful panorama of
the Riviera was unfolding itself before
the eyes of the shipowner. The red rocks
and the dwarf pines of the Esterel coves, against
which an azure sea lapped in soft caress.... Cannes
with its far-flung draperies of white villas.... The
proud solemnity of the Alpes Maritimes thrusting
up to the snow-line and glinting white against
the sun.... Fairy bungalows nesting in tropic
gardens and waving welcome with their palm-fronds
to the rushing train.... The Baie des Anges
laughing with sky and hills.... The many-tunnelled
cliff-route from Villefranche to Cap D'Ail,
where moments of darkness tease one to longing
for the sight of the azure coves dotted with white-winged
yachts and foam-slashed motor-boats.... Europe's
silken, jewelled fringe!</p>

<p>But scenery made no appeal to Lars Larssen.
Scenery would not help him to the attainment of
his great ambitions. Scenery was <i>no use</i> to him.
His delight lay in men and women and the using
of them. Business&mdash;the turning of other men's
energies to his own ends&mdash;was the very breath of
his being.</p>

<p>He was glad to reach the hectic crowdedness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the tiny principality of Monaco&mdash;that triple essence
of civilization and sensuous luxury. He felt at
home with the big idea that drew the whole world
to the gaming tables to pay homage to the goddess
Fortune. For a moment the suggestion came to
him to buy up some beautiful islet and build a
pleasure city on it which should be a wonder of
the world. He was making a note of it for future
consideration, when Olive and her father met him
on the platform at Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you would bring John
Rivi&egrave;re with you," said Olive after they had exchanged
greetings. A strong desire had sprung up
to see this mysterious relation of Clifford's, and to
be balked of any passing whim was keen annoyance
to her.</p>

<p>"Bring a will-o'-the-wisp," answered Larssen.</p>

<p>"Can't you find him?" asked Sir Francis.
Larssen shook his head. "Gad, that's curious.
Why doesn't he write? Bad form, you know. But
when a man's lived all his life in the backwoods of
Canada, I suppose one can't expect him to know
what's what."</p>

<p>Olive studied the shipowner keenly as they drove
to their hotel. His massive strength of body and
masterful purpose of mind, showing in every line of
his face, attracted her strongly. Olive worshipped
power, money, and all that breathed of them.
Here was the living embodiment of money and
power.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening all three went to the
Casino. The order had been given to Sir Francis
Letchmere's valet that he was to bring over to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Salle de Jeux any telegram or 'phone message that
might arrive.</p>

<p>Larssen was keenly interested in the throng of
smart men and women clustered around the tables.
Here was the raw material of his craft&mdash;human
nature. Moths around a candle&mdash;well, he himself
had lit many candles. The process of singeing
their wings intrigued him vastly.</p>

<p>Olive explained the game to him with a flush of
excitement on her cheeks. He noted that flush
and made a mental note to use it for his own ends.
She took a seat at a roulette table and asked him to
advise her where to stake her money. Sir Francis
preferred <i>trente-et-quarante</i>, and went off to another
table.</p>

<p>"I can see you've been born lucky," she whispered
to Larssen.</p>

<p>"I'll try to share it with you," he answered, and
suggested some numbers with firm, decisive confidence.
Though he had keen pride in his intellect
and his will, he had also firm reliance on his intuitive
sense. With Lars Larssen, all three worked hand
in hand.</p>

<p>Olive began to win. Her eyes sparkled, and she
exchanged little gay pleasantries and compliments
with the shipowner.</p>

<p>"We've made all the loose hay out of <i>this</i> sunshine,"
said Larssen after an hour or so, when a
spell of losing set in. "Now we'll move to another
table."</p>

<p>Olive obeyed him with alacrity. She liked his
masterful orders. Here was a man to whom one
could give confidence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Five louis on <i>carr&eacute;</i> 16-20," he advised suddenly
when they had found place at another table.</p>

<p>Without hesitation she placed a gold hundred-franc
piece on the intersecting point of the four
squares 16, 17, 19, 20. The croupier flicked the
white marble between thumb and second finger,
and it whizzed round the roulette board like an echo
round the whispering gallery of St Paul's. At
length it slowed down, hit against a metal deflector,
and dropped sharply into one of the thirty-seven
compartments of the roulette board. A croupier
silently touched the square of 16 with his rake to
indicate that this number had won, and the other
croupier proceeded to gather in the stakes.</p>

<p>Forty louis in notes were pushed over to Olive.</p>

<p>At this moment Sir Francis' valet came up to
Larssen with a telegram in his hand. The latter
opened and scanned it quickly.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Olive.</p>

<p>"A tip to gamble the limit on number 14,"
replied Larssen smilingly.</p>

<p>Olive placed nine louis, the limit stake, on number
14, and two minutes later a pile of bank-notes
aggregating 6300 francs came to her from the
croupier's metal box.</p>

<p>"You're Midas!" she whispered exultantly.</p>

<p>"Midas has a hurry call to the 'phone," he
answered.</p>

<p>For the telegram was from Sylvester, and it
read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fourteen replies to hand. Fourteen J. Rivi&egrave;re's
scattered about France."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">LARSSEN TURNS ANOTHER CORNER</span></h2>


<p>"Clifford is a very shrewd man of
business," remarked Larssen, drinking his
third cognac at Ciro's at the end of a
dinner which was a masterpiece even for Monte
Carlo, where dining is taken <i>au grand s&eacute;rieux</i>. He
did not sip cognac, but took it neat in liqueur
glassfuls at a time. There was a clean-cut forcefulness
even in his drinking, typical of the human
dynamo of will-power within.</p>

<p>Sir Francis puffed out a cloud of cigar-smoke with
an air of reflected glory. He had helped to capture
Matheson as a son-in-law, and a compliment of this
kind was therefore an indirect compliment to
himself.</p>

<p>The capture of Matheson was, in fact, the most
notable achievement of his career. Beyond that,
he had done little but ornament the Boards of
companies with his name; manage his estate
(through an agent) with a mixture of cross conservatism
and despotic benevolence; and shoot, hunt
and fish with impeccable "good form." He was
typical of that very large class of leisured landowner
in whose creed good form is next above godliness.</p>

<p>"Yes, Clifford has his head screwed on right,"
he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before he left for Canada," continued Larssen,
"he managed to gouge me for a tidy extra in shares
for you and for Mrs Matheson."</p>

<p>Olive had been markedly listless, heavy-eyed and
abstracted during the course of the dinner, a point
which Larssen had noted with some puzzlement.
His mind had worked over the reasons for it without
arriving at any definite conclusion. But now, at
this unexpected announcement, her eyes lighted
up greedily.</p>

<p>"For me!" she exclaimed. "That's more than I
expected from Clifford."</p>

<p>The shipowner reached to take out some papers
from his breast-pocket, then stopped. "I was
forgetting. I oughtn't to be talking shop over the
dinner-table."</p>

<p>Sir Francis made an inarticulate noise which was
a kind of tribute to the fetish of good form. He
wanted to hear more, but did not want to ask to
hear more.</p>

<p>"Please go on," said Olive. "Talk business
now just as much as you like. Unless, of
course, you'd rather not discuss details while I'm
here."</p>

<p>"I'd sooner talk business with you present, Mrs
Matheson. I think a wife has every right to be her
husband's business partner. I think it's good for
both sides. When my dear wife was with me, we
were share-and-share partners." He paused for a
moment, then continued: "Here's the draft scheme
for the flotation."</p>

<p>He held out a paper between Sir Francis and
Olive, and Sir Francis took it and read it over with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
an air of concentrated, conscious wisdom&mdash;the air
he carefully donned at Board meetings, together
with a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez.</p>

<p>"Clifford will be Chairman," explained Larssen.
"You and Lord St Aubyn and Carleton-Wingate
are the men I want for the other Directors. I, as
vendor, join the Board after allotment."</p>

<p>"Where's the point about shares for me?"
asked Sir Francis, reading on.</p>

<p>"That doesn't appear in the prospectus, of course.
A private arrangement between Clifford and myself.
Here's the memorandum."</p>

<p>This he handed to Olive, who nodded her head
with pleasure as she read it through, her father
looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Keep it," said Larssen as she made to hand it
back. "Keep it till your husband returns from
Canada."</p>

<p>"When did he say he will be back?"</p>

<p>"It's very uncertain. He doesn't know himself.
It's a delicate matter to handle&mdash;very delicate.
That's why he went himself to Montreal."</p>

<p>"He wired me that he's travelling under an
assumed name."</p>

<p>"Very prudent," commented Larssen.</p>

<p>"I don't quite like it," murmured Sir Francis.
"Not the right thing, you know."</p>

<p>Larssen did not answer, but Olive rejoined
sharply: "What does it matter if it helps to get
the flotation off and make money?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps so. Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you fix up St Aubyn and Carleton-Wingate?"
asked Larssen. "Quickly?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I expect so. But has Clifford approved
this scheme?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Have you it with you?"</p>

<p>"Have I what?"</p>

<p>"I mean the agreement Clifford signed."</p>

<p>Sir Francis, without knowing it, had stumbled
upon the crucial weakness of Larssen's daring
scheme. But it would have taken a far shrewder
man than he to realize the vital import of the point
from Larssen's easy, almost causal answer:</p>

<p>"There's no signed agreement. We agreed the
scheme in principle at the interview in Clifford's
office, and he left details to you and me. His last
words were: 'Tell my father-in-law to go ahead
as quickly as he can manage.'"</p>

<p>"But when I put this before St Aubyn and
Carleton-Wingate, they'll be expecting me to&mdash;I
mean to say, isn't it deuced irregular, you know?"</p>

<p>Larssen did not answer this for a moment. He
had a keen appreciation of the value of silence
in business negotiations. He poured himself out
another glass of cognac and drank it off. His
attitude conveyed a contempt for Letchmere's
cautiousness which he would be too polite to put
into words.</p>

<p>"If you'd sooner write to Clifford and have his
agreement to the scheme in black and white ..."
was his studiously, chilly reply.</p>

<p>Olive put in a word: "I dislike all those niggling
formalities."</p>

<p>"Business is business," quoted her father
sententiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Besides, Clifford will be back before the prospectus
goes to the public."</p>

<p>"Probably," agreed Larssen. "But in case he
is not back in time, we're to go ahead just as if he
were here. That's what he told me before he left
Paris. Didn't he write you to that effect, Sir
Francis?"</p>

<p>"I heard nothing from him."</p>

<p>"But I showed you my telegram," answered
Olive. "Clifford said to refer to Mr Larssen for
all details."</p>

<p>"I must think matters over," said the baronet
obstinately.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen had been studying his man through
half-closed eyelids, and he now summed him up
with penetrating accuracy. It was not suspicion
that made Sir Francis hesitate, but petty dignity.
He had become huffed. He felt that his dignity
had not been sufficiently studied in the transaction.
Matters had been arranged over his head without
formally consulting him. It was "not the thing"&mdash;"not
good form."</p>

<p>To attempt to force matters would merely drive
him into deeper obstinacy.</p>

<p>And yet it was <i>vital</i> to Larssen's plan that Sir
Francis should go ahead with the work of the
flotation quickly&mdash;should go ahead with it in the
full belief that Clifford Matheson had agreed to the
scheme and to the use of his name. It was vital
that Sir Francis should take the whole responsibility
of the flotation on to his own shoulders. He
was to make use of his son-in-law's name with the
other prospective Directors and on the printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
prospectus just as though Matheson were personally
sanctioning it.</p>

<p>Larssen himself planned to remain in the background
and pull the wires unseen. When the
revelation of Matheson's death came to light&mdash;as
it inevitably must in the course of time&mdash;Letchmere
would be so far involved that he would
be forced to shoulder responsibility for the use of
Matheson's name.</p>

<p>To try to rush matters with Sir Francis would
perhaps wreck the whole delicate machinery of the
scheme. Larssen quickly resolved to get at him in
indirect fashion through Olive, and accordingly he
answered evenly:</p>

<p>"Think it over by all means. There's plenty to
consider. Take the draft scheme and look it
through at your leisure.... Now what's the plan
of amusement for to-night?"</p>

<p>Before going to the Casino, Olive made an excuse
to return to her rooms at the Hesp&eacute;rides. Alone in
her bedroom, she took out from a locked drawer a
hypodermic syringe in silver and glass, and a phial
of colourless liquid. She held the phial in her
hands with a curious look of furtive tenderness,
fondling it softly. For many months past this
had been her cherished secret&mdash;the drug that unlocked
for her new realms of fancy and exquisite
sensation.</p>

<p>To herself she called it by a pet name, as though
it were a lover.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening's play at the tables,
Larssen was struck with her increasing animation
and gaiety. The heavy, listless look had left her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
eyes, and they now glittered with life and fire.
When they left the tables to stroll by the milk-white
terraces of the Casino, there was a flush in her
cheeks and iridescence in her speech very different
from a couple of hours before.</p>

<p>A spirit of caustic, impish brilliance was in her.
She turned it upon the people they had rubbed
shoulders with at the tables; upon the people
walking past them on the terraces; even upon her
husband:</p>

<p>"Clifford is a 90 per cent. success. There are
men who can never achieve full success in any field
whatever. They climb up to 70, 80, 90 per cent.,
and then the grade is too steep for them."</p>

<p>"They stick."</p>

<p>"Or run backwards downhill. I'm a passenger
in a car of that kind. Near to the top, but not
reaching it. So I get out to walk on myself."</p>

<p>"There are mighty few men who have the
100 per cent. in them."</p>

<p>"Tell me this, Mr Larssen. Did you know you
were a 100 per cent. man when you started your
business life, or did you come to realize it
gradually?"</p>

<p>"I knew it from the first," replied the shipowner
steadily. "Knew it when I was a mere kiddy.
Set myself apart from the other boys. Told myself
I was to be their master. Made myself master.
Fought for it. Fought every boy who wouldn't
acknowledge it.... When I went to sea as cabin-boy
on the "Mary R." of Gloucester, the men on
the trawler tried to "lick me into shape," as they
called it. They didn't know what they were up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
against. I used those men as whet-stones&mdash;used
them to kick fear out of myself. You notice that
I limp a little? That's a legacy from the days of
the 'Mary R.'"</p>

<p>Olive looked at him with open admiration.
"That's epic!" she exclaimed. "How far are you
going to climb?"</p>

<p>Larssen had never revealed to any man or woman&mdash;save
only to his wife&mdash;the great ultimate purpose
of his life. He did not tell it to Olive. She was to
be used as a pawn in the great game, just as he was
using Sir Francis and the dead Clifford Matheson.
It came upon him that she was now a widow. He
would fan her open admiration so as to make use
of it when she awoke to the fact of her widowhood.</p>

<p>So he answered: "How far I climb depends
on the help of my best friends. I don't hide
that. When my dear wife was with me, she was
an inspiration to me. No man can drive his
car to the summit without a woman to spur him
on."</p>

<p>"Did marriage change you much?"</p>

<p>"Strengthened me. Bolted me to my foundations.... But
here I'm monopolizing the conversation
with talk about myself. Let's switch. What
are <i>your</i> ambitions?"</p>

<p>Olive laughed&mdash;a laugh with a bitter taste in it.
"I wanted to help a man to drive his car to the
summit, and the car has stuck. I could inspire,
but my inspiring goes to waste. I'm an engine racing
without a shaft to take up its energy. Clifford
is developing scruples. I don't know where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
caught them. I can't stand sick people. That's
my temperament&mdash;I must have energy and action
around me."</p>

<p>"I understand that. Felt it myself at times,"
he answered sympathetically.</p>

<p>Without apparent reason her thoughts skipped to
a woman who had sat near them at the roulette
table. "Wasn't she the image of a disappointed
vulture? I mean the woman in green. Swooping
down from a distance to gorge herself with a tasty
feast, and then finding a man with a rake to chase
her off. I chuckled to myself as I watched her.
Do men and women look to you like animals?
They do to me. Monte Carlo's a Zoo, only the
animals aren't caged."</p>

<p>"That's right! You're an extraordinarily keen
observer, Mrs Matheson."</p>

<p>Sir Francis Letchmere approached them beamingly
from the direction of the Casino. He had won
money at <i>trente-et-quarante</i>, and was feeling very
pleased with his own judgment and powers of
intellect generally.</p>

<p>"Leave him to me," whispered Olive to Larssen.
"I'll see that my father gets busy on the Hudson
Bay Scheme. But on one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That you stay on at Monte for a few days.
I don't want to be left here alone. I hate being
alone."</p>

<p>"I'm due back in London. Urgent business
matters."</p>

<p>"Leave them for a few days. Leave them to
your managers. Stay here and amuse me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Larssen knew when to give way&mdash;or seem to give
way&mdash;and how to do so gracefully.</p>

<p>"I'll stay on without asking any conditions,"
he answered with flattering cordiality. "It's not
often I get a command so pleasant to carry out!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">A LETTER FROM RIVI&Egrave;RE</span></h2>


<p>Olive made good her promise at once.
She packed her father back to England
the very next day, to get to work on the
Hudson Bay flotation, and Lars Larssen remained
on at Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Though he had led Olive to believe that he had
given in merely to please her, yet his true motive
was very different. His feelings towards her held
no scrap of passion in them. He knew her as vain,
shallow, feverishly pleasure-seeking&mdash;a glittering
dragon-fly. As a woman she made no appeal to
him. But as a tool to serve in the attaining of his
ambitions, she might conceivably be highly useful.</p>

<p>His true motive in remaining at Monte Carlo was
double-edged&mdash;to bring Olive into the orbit of his
fascination, and to mark time until the mystery of
John Rivi&egrave;re had been set at rest.</p>

<p>John Rivi&egrave;re worried him. Deep down in his
being was a keen intuitive feeling that this mysterious
half-brother of the dead man was in some way
linked up with the attainment of his ambitions&mdash;to
help or to hinder.</p>

<p>Why had he not come to Monte Carlo as arranged?
Why had he sent no line to Olive to excuse himself?
Why had he made no further inquiry about Clifford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Matheson&mdash;or had he indeed made some inquiry
which might set him on the track of his brother's
disappearance?</p>

<p>It was vital to know how matters stood with this
John Rivi&egrave;re before he could march forward unhesitatingly
with the Hudson Bay flotation.</p>

<p>The result of the advertisements in the Paris newspapers
was annoying. Where the shipowner had
hoped for one answer&mdash;or perhaps a couple pointing
in the same direction&mdash;over a dozen had been
received. This meant waste of precious time while
Sylvester unravelled them. Over the 'phone
Larssen and his secretary had discussed the various
answers; rejected some of them; wired for confirmatory
details in respect of others. Provincial
hotel-keepers and railway guards were so keenly
"on the make" that they were ready to swear to
identity on the slenderest basis of fact.</p>

<p>In pursuit of two of the clues, Sylvester travelled
as far north as Valognes in the Cotentin, and as
far east as G&eacute;rardmer in the Hautes-Vosges. Both
journeys were fruitless, and worse than fruitless&mdash;waste
of precious time and energy.</p>

<p>While Larssen waited eagerly for definite news
from his secretary with whom he kept constantly
in touch by telegram, news came in unexpected
fashion through Olive.</p>

<p>"I've just heard from Rivi&egrave;re," she announced.
"He's at Arles&mdash;down with a touch of fever. That's
the reason he hadn't written before. Those scientist
people are terribly casual in social matters."</p>

<p>"May I see the letter?" asked Lars Larssen.
His reason for asking was a desire to study the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
man's handwriting and draw conclusions from it.
He was a keen student of handwriting.</p>

<p>After he had read through the note he remarked
drily: "I guess I can give you another reason."</p>

<p>"For his not writing?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... <i>Cherchez la femme.</i>"</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"This note was written by a woman."</p>

<p>"It's a very decided hand for a woman."</p>

<p>"Yes it is. I'd stake big on that. Look at the
long crossings to the t's. Look at the way the
date is written. Look at the way words run into
one another."</p>

<p>Olive examined the letter carefully, and laughed.
"You're right," said she. "He's travelling with
some woman. Those men who are supposed to be
wrapped up in their scientific experiments&mdash;you
can't trust them far!"</p>

<p>Then she added with a curious touch of conscious
virtue: "But he'd no right to get that woman to
send a letter to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Larssen had noted the printed heading to the
letter, "Hotel du Forum, Arles," and he wired at
once to Morris Sylvester to proceed to Arles and
hunt out further details. It seemed an unnecessary
precaution, but the shipowner never neglected the
tiniest detail when he had a big scheme to engineer.</p>

<p>His relief at the letter proved short-lived. Late
that night came a message from Sylvester:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rivi&egrave;re not at Arles and not down with fever.
Am following up further clues. Will wire again in
the morning."</p>

<p>Larssen did not show this wire to Olive. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
told her nothing of his search for Rivi&egrave;re&mdash;had not
even appeared specially interested in him. But in
point of fact his interest in the mysterious half-brother
of the dead man was steadily growing with
every fresh check to the search. The intuition on
which he placed such firm faith told him insistently
that John Rivi&egrave;re was a factor vital to the fulfilment
of his ambitions.</p>

<p>All the morning he looked for the telegram his
secretary was to send him. It came in the early
afternoon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have found Rivi&egrave;re under extraordinary circumstances.
Letter and photograph follow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE SECOND MEETING</span></h2>


<p>Europe's beauty-spots of to-day were the
beauty-spots of the Roman Empire two
thousand years ago. Wherever the traveller
around Europe now reaches a place that makes
instant appeal; where harsh winds are screened
away and blazing sunshine filters through feathery
foliage; where all Nature beckons one to halt and
rest awhile&mdash;there he is practically certain to find
Roman remains. The wealthy Romans wintered at
Nice and Cannes and St Raphael; took the waters
at Baden-Baden and Aix in Savoy; made sporting
centres of Treves on the Moselle and Ronda in
Andalusia; dallied by the marble baths of N&icirc;mes.</p>

<p>N&icirc;mes had captured Rivi&egrave;re at sight. His first
day in that leisured, peaceful, fragrant town, nestling
amongst the hills against the keen <i>mistral</i>, had decided
him to settle there for some weeks. He had
taken a couple of furnished rooms in a villa with a
delightful old-world garden. For a lengthy stay
he much preferred his own rooms to the transiency
and restlessness of a hotel, and at the Villa Cl&eacute;mentine
he had found exactly what he required. The
living-room opened wide to the sun. One stepped
out from its French windows into the garden, where
a little pebbly path led one wandering amongst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
oleanders and dwarf oranges and flaming cannas,
to a corner where a tiny fountain made a home for
lazy goldfish floating in placid contentment under
the hot sun. Here there was an arbour wreathed
in gentle wisteria, where Rivi&egrave;re took breakfast and
the mid-day meal. At nightfall a chill snapped
down with the suddenness of the impetuousness
Midi, and his evening meal was accordingly taken
indoors.</p>

<p>Besides this little private preserve of his own,
there was the beautiful public garden of N&icirc;mes&mdash;called
the Jardin de la Fontaine&mdash;draping a hillside
that looks down upon the marble baths of the
Romans, almost as freshly new to-day as two
thousand years ago. A thick battalion of trees at
the summit of the hillside makes stubborn insistence
to the northern <i>mistral</i>, so that even when the
wind tears over the plains of Provence like a wild
fury, scourging and freezing, the Jardin de la
Fontaine is serene and windless. The <i>mistral</i> goes
always with a cloudless sky, as though the clouds
were fleeing from its icy keenness, and the sun pours
full upon the semi-circle of the Jardin de la Fontaine,
turning it to a hothouse where the most delicate
plants and shrubs can find a home.</p>

<p>Here men and women in toga and flowing
draperies have whiled away leisure hours, spun
day-dreams, made love, or schemed affairs of
state and personal ambition. To-day, it is still
the resort of N&icirc;mes where everyone meets everyone
else, either by design or by the chance
intercourse of a small town.</p>

<p>On a morning of <i>mistral</i>, Rivi&egrave;re was seated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the pleasant warmth of the Jardin, planning out a
special piece of apparatus for his coming research-work.
He was concentrating intently&mdash;so intently
that he did not notice Miss Verney passing him with
a very professional-looking campstool, easel and
sketch-book.</p>

<p>This second encounter was pure accident. Elaine
had no intentions whatever of following the man
who had left Arles with such boorish brusqueness,
without even the conventional good-bye at the
breakfast-table. She had come to N&icirc;mes because
she was a worker, because this town contained
special material necessary to her bread-winning.</p>

<p>She had guessed that Rivi&egrave;re's hurried departure
from Arles was made in order to avoid meeting her.
It hurt. Woman-like, she set more value on a few
pleasant words of farewell over a breakfast-table
and a warm handshake than on a defence from
assault at the risk of a man's life. The seeming
illogicality of woman is of course a mere surface
illusion. It hides a train of reasoning very different
to a man's. It is a mental short-cut like an Irishman's
"bull," which condenses a whole chain of
thought into a single link.</p>

<p>In this case Elaine knew that Rivi&egrave;re's rescue
held no personal significance. He did not know at
the time that it was <i>she</i> who was being attacked.
He would have gone to the defence of any woman
under similar circumstances. While altruism appealed
to her strongly in a broad, general way, it
did not appeal when it came home in such a specific,
individual fashion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a warm handshake at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
breakfast-table would have its personal significance.
It would be a homage to herself, and not to women
in general. Its value would lie in its personal
meaning.</p>

<p>While she knew this thought was ungenerous, yet
at the same time she knew that behind it there lay
a sound basis of reason.</p>

<p>Her pride&mdash;that form of pride which is a very
wholesome self-respect&mdash;made her flush at the
thought that Rivi&egrave;re would see her and imagine, in
a man's way, that she had followed him to N&icirc;mes.
She hurried on past him with a rapid side-glance.
The situation was an awkward one. She had her
work to do by the old Roman baths and the Druid's
Tower on the hillside, and she could not leave N&icirc;mes
without doing it.</p>

<p>When he came face to face with her, perhaps it
would be best to give a cold bow of formal recognition&mdash;the
kind of bow that says "Good morning.
I'm busy. You're not wanted."</p>

<p>And yet, there was news for him in her possession
of which he ought to be informed. It was only fair
to the man who had defended her at considerable
personal risk that she should do him this small
service in return. In her pocket was a cutting of
an advertisement in a Parisian paper, several days
old, asking for the whereabouts of John Rivi&egrave;re.
Very possibly he had not seen it himself. It was
only fair to let him know of it. The stitches in his
forehead, which she had noted as she hurried past&mdash;these
called mutely for the small service in return.</p>

<p>Elaine decided to wait until he recognized her, to
give him the advertisement, and then to conclude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
their acquaintanceship with a few formal words of
which the meaning would be unmistakable. Accordingly
she set her campstool not far away from
him, and began her sketching in a vigorous, characteristic
fashion.</p>

<p>It was an hour or more before her intuition
warned her that Rivi&egrave;re was approaching from
behind. As he passed, she raised her eyes quite
naturally as though to look at the subject she was
finishing. Their eyes met. Rivi&egrave;re raised his hat
politely but without any special significance. His
attitude conveyed no desire to renew their acquaintance.
He did not stop to exchange a few words,
as she expected.</p>

<p>Elaine was hurt. She felt that he should at least
have given her the opportunity to refuse acquaintanceship.
And a sudden resolve fired up within
her to humble this man of ice&mdash;to melt him, and
bring him to her feet, and then to dismiss him.</p>

<p>"Mr Rivi&egrave;re," she called.</p>

<p>He stopped, and answered with a formal "Good
morning."</p>

<p>"I have something for you&mdash;some news."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Do you know that your friends are getting
anxious about you?"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re's attention concentrated. "Which
friends?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know which friends. But there's an
advertisement in a Paris paper asking for your
whereabouts."</p>

<p>"Thank you for letting me know. What does it
say?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>She produced the cutting and handed it to him.
He studied it in silence. There was no hint in its
wording as to who was making inquiry&mdash;the advertisement
merely asked for replies to be sent to
a box number care of the journal. It struck Rivi&egrave;re
that it must have been inserted by Olive.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "I hadn't seen it
before."</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask something in return," said
Elaine, and smiled at him frankly. "I want to
know why you're running away from your Monte
Carlo friends."</p>

<p>Most women of Rivi&egrave;re's world would have
cloaked their curiosity under some conventional,
indirect form of question. Her frank directness
struck him as refreshing, and he answered readily:
"The lady you saw in the C&ocirc;te d'Azur Rapide
was my sister-in-law, Mrs Matheson. Mrs Clifford
Matheson."</p>

<p>"The wife of that man!" she interrupted.
There was anger and contempt in her voice.</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"My father lost the last remains of his money in
one of that man's companies. It hastened his
death."</p>

<p>"Which company?"</p>

<p>"The Saskatchewan Land Development Co. My
father bought during the early boom in the shares."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re remembered that he himself had cleared
&pound;50,000 over the flotation, and the remembrance
jarred on him. The company was a moderately
successful one, but in its early days the shares had
been "rigged" to an unreal figure. Still, he felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
compelled, almost against his will, to defend his
past action.</p>

<p>"Did he buy for investment or merely for speculation?"
asked Rivi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>"I know very little about such matters."</p>

<p>"As an investment, it would to-day be paying a
moderate dividend."</p>

<p>"My father had to sell again at a big loss."</p>

<p>"It sounds very like speculation."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to hear of the loss; but a man
who speculates in the stock market must look out
for himself. It's a risky game for the outsider to
play."</p>

<p>Elaine silently recognized the truth of his words.
Then it came to her suddenly that Rivi&egrave;re had, a few
moments ago, used the word "sister-in-law," and
she said: "I was forgetting that Mr Matheson must
be a relative of yours."</p>

<p>"My half-brother."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a searching frankness that
was in its way a tacit compliment. He was radically
different to the mental picture she had formed
of the financier.</p>

<p>He continued: "The lady you saw in the train
was my sister-in-law. As you already know, she
expects me to join her at Monte Carlo. I don't
want to be drawn into that kind of life. I want
to remain quiet. I have important work to
do."</p>

<p>"Scientific work, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And there's a big stretch of it in front of
me. That's why I'm not travelling on to Monte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Carlo. You understand my position now, Miss
Verney?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"I'm right in calling you <i>Miss</i> Verney?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Then she added: "And you're wondering
why an unmarried woman should be wandering
alone amongst the by-ways of France?"</p>

<p>"I can see that you also have work to do."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re looked towards her almost finished sketch
of the Roman baths. She removed it and passed
him the rest of the book. He found the book filled
with curiously formal sketches and paintings of
scenery&mdash;woodland glades, open heaths, temples,
arenas, and so on. These sketches caught
boldly at the high-lights of what they pictured,
and ignored detail. The colouring was also very
noticeably simplified&mdash;"impressionistic" would
better express it.</p>

<p>"They look like stage scenes," he commented.</p>

<p>"They are. Sketches for stage scenes. I'm a
scene painter. Just now I'm gathering material
for the staging of a Roman drama with a
setting in Roman Provence. Barr&egrave;ze is to produce
it at the Od&eacute;on. It's my first big
chance."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re pointed to one of her sketches. "Wasn't
this worked into a scene for 'Ames Nues,' at the
Chatelet?"</p>

<p>"Quite right!"</p>

<p>"I remember being very much impressed by it at
the time.... Yours must be particularly interesting
work?"</p>

<p>"The work one likes best is always peculiarly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
interesting. That's happiness&mdash;to have the work
one likes best."</p>

<p>Seeing that Rivi&egrave;re was genuinely interested,
she began to dilate on her work, explaining something
of its technique, telling of its peculiar difficulties.
She showed him her sketches taken at
Arles; mentioned Orange, for its Roman arch and
theatre, as a stopping-place on her return journey
to Paris. There was a glow in her voice that told
clearly of her absorption in her chosen work.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re was enjoying the frank camaraderie of
their conversation. Suddenly the thought of the
newspaper cutting came back to him sharply. If
Olive had inserted that advertisement, she must
have some special reason for it. Perhaps she
wanted to communicate with him in reference to
the "death" of Matheson. Some hotel-keeper or
railway-guard would no doubt have seen the advertisement
and answered it, letting her know of
Rivi&egrave;re's stay at Arles.</p>

<p>It would be prudent to write and allay suspicion.
But he could not pen the letter himself, because his
handwriting would be recognized by Olive.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re solved the difficulty in his usual decisive
fashion. "Miss Verney," he said, "I wonder if
you would do me a very big favour without asking
for my reasons in detail? It's a most unusual
request I'm going to make."</p>

<p>Elaine remembered her resolve to thaw this man
of ice, and bring him to her feet, and then dismiss
him. She had thawed him already. To do him
some special favour would be a most excellent
means of attaining the second end. She answered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anything in reason I'll do gladly."</p>

<p>"You know that I want to avoid Monte Carlo.
I don't even want my sister-in-law to know that
I'm at N&icirc;mes."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Will you write a letter for me to say that I'm
unwell and can't travel away from Arles?"</p>

<p>Elaine looked at him searchingly. "It's certainly
a most unusual request to make of a mere acquaintance,"
she remarked.</p>

<p>"I have good reasons for asking it."</p>

<p>"Then I'll do what you ask."</p>

<p>"Would you mind coming round to my rooms?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; if you'll wait until I've finished
this sketch."</p>

<p>She worked on in silence for another quarter of an
hour, completing her picture with rapid, vigorous
brush-strokes. Then he took up her campstool and
easel, and they walked together alongside the Roman
aqueduct to the centre of the town, under an avenue
of tall, spreading plane trees, yellow with the first
delicate leaves of Spring like the feathers of a newborn
chick.</p>

<p>The sunshine caressed the little garden of the
Villa Cl&eacute;mentine, coquetting with the flaming
cannas, twinkling amongst the pebbles of the paths,
stroking the backs of the lazy goldfish. Seating
Elaine in the arbour, Rivi&egrave;re brought out pen and
ink and a sheet of paper headed "Hotel du Forum,
Place du Forum, Arles," which he happened to have
kept by accident from his visit to the town.
Then he dictated a formal letter to Mrs Matheson,
explaining that he was laid up with a touch of fever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and would not be able to join her at Monte Carlo.
The illness was not serious, and there was no cause
for anxiety. Nevertheless it kept him tied. He
hoped she would excuse him.</p>

<p>"There will be a N&icirc;mes postmark on the envelope,"
commented Elaine as she wrote the address.</p>

<p>"No; I shall go over to Arles this afternoon and
post it there. As you know, it's scarcely an hour
away by train." He glanced at his watch. "Past
twelve o'clock already! Won't you stay and take
lunch with me? Madame Giras is famous in N&icirc;mes
for her <i>bouillabaisse</i>."</p>

<p>She agreed readily, and a dainty lunch was soon
served them in the covered arbour. Over the olives
and <i>bouillabaisse</i> and the <i>&oelig;ufs proven&ccedil;als</i> they chatted
in easy, friendly fashion about impersonal matters&mdash;the
strange charm of Provence, art, music, the
theatre.</p>

<p>From that the conversation passed imperceptibly
to more personal matters. Elaine, keeping to her
resolve of the morning, led it in that direction. He
learnt that she was an orphan; that her nearest
relatives were entirely out of sympathy with her
ideas and aspirations, and profoundly distasteful to
her; that she took full pride in her independence
and the position she was carving out for herself in
the world of theatrical art.</p>

<p>"To be free; to be independent; to live your
own life; to know that you buy your bread and
bed with the money you've earned yourself&mdash;it's
fine, it's splendid!" said Elaine, with flushed cheek.
"I wonder if men ever have that feeling as strongly
as we women do?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"'To be free, sire, is only to change one's master,'"
quoted Rivi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>"'Master' is a word I should rule out of the
dictionary," she replied.</p>

<p>"And if ever your present freedom were suddenly
denied to you by Fate?"</p>

<p>She shivered, and moved a little into the full
blaze of the sunshine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the afternoon Rivi&egrave;re took train to Arles. The
way lies by vineyards and olive orchards alternating
with open, wind-swept heathland. The stunted
olive trees, twisted and gnarled, pictured themselves
to him as little old men worn and weary with their
fight against the winds. Here the <i>mistral</i> was
master and the olive trees his slaves.</p>

<p>At Arles Rivi&egrave;re posted his letter in a box on the
platform of the station, and asked of a porter when
the next train would take him back to N&icirc;mes.
Standing close by as he asked this question was a
lean, wiry, crafty-looking peasant of the Camargue&mdash;a
hard-bit youth toughened by his work on the
soil. The most prominent feature of the face was
the nose smashed out of shape. Rivi&egrave;re did not
know that it was he himself who had left that life-mark
on the young man only a few days before&mdash;he
had almost forgotten the incident&mdash;but the
latter recognized Rivi&egrave;re at once and went white
with anger under the tanned skin.</p>

<p>Whilst he would have taken a blow from the
knife as "all in the game," a smash from a bare
fist that made a permanent disfigurement was
completely outside his code of sportsmanship. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
resented it with the white-hot passion of the
Midi.</p>

<p>The meeting was pure chance. Crau, the young
Proven&ccedil;al, was on the station to take train back to
his home village in the marshes. Now he made a
sudden resolution, and going to the booking-office,
asked for a ticket for N&icirc;mes. He had relations in
that town&mdash;small tradespeople&mdash;and he would pay
a visit to them for a few days.</p>

<p>"Our game is not yet finished, Mr Englishman,"
he muttered to himself. "No, not yet finished!"</p>

<p>When the train reached N&icirc;mes, Rivi&egrave;re alighted
from a first-class compartment, quite unconscious
of being followed by the young Proven&ccedil;al from a
third-class compartment. Outside the station, in
the broad Avenue de la Gare that leads to the heart
of the town, Rivi&egrave;re hailed a cab and gave the
address, Villa Cl&eacute;mentine.</p>

<p>Crau was near enough to overhear.</p>

<p>"Villa Cl&eacute;mentine," he repeated to himself, and
again "Villa Cl&eacute;mentine," to fit it securely in his
memory. Then his lips worked with passionate
revenge as he thought: "You have spoilt my
looks, Mr Englishman; and now, <i>sangredieu</i>, to
spoil yours!"</p>

<p>Before going to his relations, he went first to a
chemist's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">AT THE MAISON CARR&Eacute;E</span></h2>


<p>The mystery of John Rivi&egrave;re intrigued
Elaine. There was certainly a mysterious
something about this man which she had
not fathomed. His most open confidences held
deep reserves. If he had not avowed himself a
scientist, she would have classed him as a man of
business. In those brief comments on Stock Exchange
speculation, he had spoken in a tone of easy
authority which goes only with intimate knowledge.
He was no recluse, but a man of the world&mdash;a man
who had clearly moved amongst men and women
and held his place with ease.</p>

<p>The idea that he was a boor had been entirely
shelved. But why that brusque, boorish disappearance
from Arles?</p>

<p>Elaine, thinking matters over in the solitude of
her room on the evening of the second encounter,
was beginning to regret her resolve to humble John
Rivi&egrave;re. It began to appear petty and unworthy.
She had no doubt now that she could bring him to
her feet if she wished, by skilful acting. Or even&mdash;in
her thoughts she whispered it to herself&mdash;or even
without acting a part.</p>

<p>But that thought she thrust aside. She had her
work to do in the world&mdash;the work that she loved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
It called imperiously for all her energies. She was
free, she was independent, her daily bread was of
her own buying; and she wished circumstances to
remain as they were.</p>

<p>Elaine decided to give up her petty resolve. She
would avoid meeting him intentionally, and if they
met, she would bring the plane of conversation
down again to the superficiality of mere tourist
acquaintanceship&mdash;"meet to-day and part to-morrow."</p>

<p>For his part, Rivi&egrave;re had found keen enjoyment
in this frank camaraderie. They met as equals on
the mental plane. Both were profoundly interested
in their respective life-work. They held ideas in
common on a score of impersonal topics. He told
himself that he had behaved very boorishly in his
abrupt departure from Arles. It had been unnecessary,
as Chance had now pointed out to him by this
second accidental encounter. This acquaintanceship
was the merest passing of "ships that pass in
the night"&mdash;in a day or two she would be away
and back to Paris, and in all human probability
they would never meet again.</p>

<p>It was generous of her to have greeted him as
though she had not noticed the abruptness of his
departure from Arles. It was generous of her to
have clipped out the newspaper advertisement and
to have called his attention to it. He mentally
apologized to her for his curt behaviour.</p>

<p>The next morning, Rivi&egrave;re did not find Elaine at
the Jardin de la Fontaine. He wanted to meet
her. He wanted to let her know indirectly what
he was feeling. And so, almost unconsciously, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
found himself walking away from the Jardin towards
the centre of the town, towards the ruined arena
and the Roman temple known as the Maison Carr&eacute;e.
Most probably she would be sketching at one or
other of them.</p>

<p>He found her at the Maison Carr&eacute;e&mdash;a square
Roman temple on which Time has laid no rougher
hand than on a white-haired mother still rosy of
cheek and young of heart. Elaine was sketching it
in her book with the bold lines of the scene-painter,
ignoring detail and working only for the high-lights
and deep shadows. Round her, peeking over her
shoulders and chattering shrilly, were a group of
children. In the background lounged a young
Proven&ccedil;al peasant with a nose twisted out of
shape.</p>

<p>"Shall I lure the children away?" asked Rivi&egrave;re
as he raised his soft felt hat.</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;it would be a relief," answered Elaine,
but with a coldness in her greeting that struck him
as curious.</p>

<p>A few coppers scattered the children; the peasant
slunk sullenly away. His eye and Rivi&egrave;re's met,
but there was no recognition on the part of the
latter.</p>

<p>"Are you working this morning?" asked Elaine
presently.</p>

<p>"No, I'm learning." He nodded towards her
sketch-book. "May I continue the lesson?"</p>

<p>"Compliments are barred," she replied stiffly.
"I neither give nor take them."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re groped mentally for the reason of this
curious change of attitude. Yesterday she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
been frankly friendly; to-day she held herself
distinctly aloof. Had he offended her in some
way?</p>

<p>He continued soberly. "I'm not paying insincere
compliments. It isn't your sketch which interests
me so much as your method of sketching. The
directness of it. The way you get to the heart of
the subject without worrying over detail. The
incisiveness. I'm mentally applying your method
to the problems of my own work.... To stand here
and watch you sketching is pure selfishness on my
part."</p>

<p>"Like other men, you imagine that women can't
get beyond detail." A flush had come into her
voice. "All through the ages men have been learning
from women and refusing to acknowledge it."</p>

<p>"In which sphere?"</p>

<p>"In every sphere."</p>

<p>"Particularize."</p>

<p>"Take novel-writing. Men sneer at the woman-novelist&mdash;say
that she cannot draw a man to the
life."</p>

<p>"It's largely true."</p>

<p>"What's the reason? Because one can't draw
to any satisfaction without models to base on.
Because a man never lets a woman into his innermost
thoughts."</p>

<p>"That argument ought to cut both ways."</p>

<p>"It doesn't. Women give up their innermost
secrets to men because&mdash;&mdash;Well, because woman
is the sex that gives and man the sex that takes.
It's been bred in and in through the whole history
of civilization."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Woman the sex that gives? That reverses
the usual idea."</p>

<p>"You're thinking of the things that don't matter&mdash;money,
jewels, dress, mansions, servants. Those
are the cheap things that man gives in return for
the gifts that are priceless."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re shook his head. "You argue only from
a limited knowledge of the world. There are plenty
of women who take everything&mdash;<i>everything</i>&mdash;and
give nothing in return. Perhaps you don't know
such women. I do."</p>

<p>"You mean women of the underworld? They
are as men make them."</p>

<p>"No, I'm thinking of <i>femmes du monde</i>. There
are plenty of virtuous married women who are as
grasping as the most soulless underworlder. Probably
you don't see them. You look at the world in
a magic crystal that mirrors back your own thoughts
and your own personality in different guises. You
see a thousand YOU's, dressed up as other people."</p>

<p>Elaine had become very thoughtful. "My magic
crystal&mdash;yes." she mused. "But surely everyone
has his or her crystal to look into."</p>

<p>"Some can keep crystal-vision and reality apart.
That's 'balance' ... And there lies the failure
of the feminists&mdash;in 'balance.' They make up a
bundle of all the iniquities of human nature, and
try to dump it on man's side of the fence."</p>

<p>"I love argument, but art is long and my stay
at N&icirc;mes very brief. To-morrow I must move on
to Orange."</p>

<p>"Then I'll not disturb you further. I expect
you have a good deal to get through."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. This afternoon it's the Pont du Gard;
this evening the Druids' Tower."</p>

<p>"This evening! The place is very lonely at
night-time."</p>

<p>"I know. But I must sketch it in moonlight.
That's essential."</p>

<p>"Remember Arles," warned Rivi&egrave;re. "You
ought not to be alone."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I know. But I have my work
to do."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re felt uneasy over the matter. He did
not wish to urge an undesired escort upon her,
but he did not like to think of her working alone
by the solitude of the Druids' Tower at night-time.</p>

<p>"If I can be of any service to you while you are
here at N&icirc;mes," he said, "you have only to send
a note to the Villa Cl&eacute;mentine."</p>

<p>With that he said good-bye and left her. It
seemed evident that he had offended her in some
way. Possibly, he thought, it was by asking her
to write that letter to Olive. Though she had
agreed willingly enough at the time, it was possible
that afterwards she had regretted it. It had
offended against her sense of right. Rivi&egrave;re felt
distressed.</p>

<p>Then the remembrance came to him that this was
the merest tourist acquaintanceship. To-morrow
she would be leaving N&icirc;mes, and the episode
would pass out of her thoughts. Probably they
would never meet again. It was not worth further
thought on either side.</p>

<p>Resolutely he banished all thoughts of Elaine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
from his mind, and concentrated on his own work-problems.</p>

<p>From the corner of a lane near the Maison Carr&eacute;e,
Crau, the young Proven&ccedil;al, had been watching
them keenly as they talked together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">BY THE DRUIDS' TOWER</span></h2>


<p>Mme Giras, the proprietress of the Villa
Cl&eacute;mentine, was a rosy, smiling body,
plumped and rounded in almost every
aspect, and with a heart of gold. Yesterday it had
been plain to her shrewd, twinkling eyes that
monsieur and mademoiselle were soon to make a
match of it. Of course it was very shocking that
mademoiselle should be travelling about alone at
her age, but much could be forgiven in so charming
a young lady.</p>

<p>When Rivi&egrave;re returned to the villa for lunch, he
found the table in the arbour laid for two, and by
one plate a rose had been placed.</p>

<p>"I have prepared for two," said Mme Giras,
smilingly. "Is it not right?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; but it will not be necessary,"
answered Rivi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>"After all my preparations! And the lunch
that was to be my <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>!" There was keen
disappointment in her voice. "But perhaps
mademoiselle will be coming to dine this evening?"</p>

<p>"No, nor this evening. Mademoiselle is very
busy with her work. She is to leave N&icirc;mes to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And monsieur also?" There was tragedy in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
her tone. It must mean that monsieur would give
up his rooms to follow the young lady.</p>

<p>"I shall probably remain here for a month or
more," answered Rivi&egrave;re somewhat stiffly: and then
to salve her feelings: "You are making me wonderfully
comfortable. I shall always associate the
Midi with Mme Giras."</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur est bien amiable!</i>" replied the little
old lady, much pleased. She hurried off to the
kitchen to see that Marie was making no error of
judgment in the mixing of the sauces.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re felt glad that the acquaintanceship with
Elaine had progressed no further. It was decidedly
for the best that it had ended where it had. Both
of them had their life-work to call for all their
energies. Further companionship would only
divert them from it. In his innermost being he
knew that, and now he acknowledged it frankly to
himself. From every point of view, it was best
that their acquaintanceship should end.</p>

<p>But late that afternoon a brief note came from
Elaine. "Dear Mr Rivi&egrave;re," it said, "I have
considered your warning. If you will be so kind
as to accompany me this evening while I am sketching
the Druids' Tower, I shall be glad. I propose
to leave the hotel about eight."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re was at her hotel punctually at eight. He
helped her into her warm travelling cloak, and taking
up her campstool and easel they walked briskly,
with healthy, swinging strides, out by the avenue
of plane trees bordering the Roman aqueduct.</p>

<p>They ascended the now deserted garden on the
hillside till they came to the ruined tower which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
was grey with age when Roman legions first swept
in triumph over the country of the barbarians of
Gaul. A chill wind set the pines and the olives
whispering mournfully together. The windowless
tower brooded over its memories of the past, like
an aged seer blind with years. The moonlight
touched it tentatively as though it feared to disturb
its dreaming.</p>

<p>It was a perfect stage scene for a secret meeting
of conspirators. In the daylight, the tower was
ugly with its rubble of fallen stones&mdash;unkempt like
a ragged tramp&mdash;but in the moonlight there was a
glamour of ages in its mournful brooding. Elaine
was right to make her sketch at night-time. Rivi&egrave;re
placed the campstool for her, and watched her in
silence as she plied her pencil with swift, decisive
lines.</p>

<p>With lithe, catlike softness, the youth Crau had
followed them up the hillside, padding noiselessly
in the shadows of the pines and olives. Crouching
behind a tree, he felt in his breast-pocket and drew
out a small package which he quietly unwrapped
from its foldings. Then he waited his moment
with every muscle tensed for action.</p>

<p>The night wind was chill. Rivi&egrave;re started to
pace up and down a few steps away from Elaine.
He approached nearer to the tree behind which
Crau was crouching in shadow.</p>

<p>The lithe, wiry figure of the young Proven&ccedil;al
sprang out upon him.</p>

<p>"Now you'll pay me what you owe!" he cried
out in Proven&ccedil;al. "You cursed pig of an
Englishman!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re did not understand the words, but the
menace in the voice left no doubt as to the meaning.
And the voice brought back to him the narrow
<i>ruelle</i> at Arles where he had defended Elaine from
the insult of the half-drunken peasant.</p>

<p>He was about to step forward to grapple with
him, when a warning cry from Elaine stopped him
for one crucial instant.</p>

<p>"Look out! There's something in his hand!"
she called, and rushed impetuously forward to make
her warning clear.</p>

<p>As she came within range, Crau raised his arm to
throw his vitriol into Rivi&egrave;re's face, but in a fraction
of a second a sudden thought changed the direction
of his aim.</p>

<p>"Your beautiful mistress! that will serve me
better!" he hissed out venomously as he flung it
full upon Elaine; then fled at top speed.</p>

<p>"My eyes! Oh God, my eyes!" she cried, as she
staggered to the ground.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re sprang to her side, white with alarm.
"The beast!"</p>

<p>"My eyes! Oh God, my eyes!" she moaned.
"My eyes&mdash;my livelihood!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">WAITING THE VERDICT</span></h2>


<p>Elaine lay in Rivi&egrave;re's room in the
Villa Cl&eacute;mentine. The doctor was injecting
morphine, and a sister of mercy, grave-eyed
under her spotless white coif like a Madonna of
Francia, spoke soft words of comfort to soothe the
agony of the blinded girl.</p>

<p>In the adjoining room Rivi&egrave;re waited the decision
of the doctor&mdash;waited in tense, straining
anxiety.</p>

<p>From that moment by the Druids' Tower when
the vitriol had been flung upon Elaine, he had lived
through a nightmare. Up on the hillside he was
impotent to relieve her agony. No house around to
take her to. Without a moment's delay he must
get her into the hands of a doctor.</p>

<p>At first he had tried to lead her down the hillside,
along the winding paths of the gardens, his hands
around her shoulders. It was too slow. Twice the
moaning girl had tripped over unseen obstacles.
Then he caught her up in his arms and ran with
her, the shadows of the trees and the undergrowth
clutching at him like mocking shapes in a Dantesque
vision of the nether world.</p>

<p>Even when down below the hillside, by the
aqueduct, they were still far from the Villa Cl&eacute;men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>tine
and yet farther from Elaine's hotel by the
station. Some conveyance was imperative. But
in a quiet country town like N&icirc;mes there are no
cabs to be found wandering around at night-time.
Nor was there carriage or motor-car in sight.</p>

<p>A peasant's cart drawn by a tiny donkey came
providentially to solve the problem. Rivi&egrave;re laid
Elaine on the straw of the cart; snatched the reins
from the owner; drove home at frantic speed; had
her put to bed in his own room by Mme Giras;
'phoned imperatively for a doctor and a nurse.</p>

<p>And now he waited in straining anxiety for the
verdict. The waiting was more horrible than the
nightmare flight through the shadows of the garden
on the hillside. That at all events had been action;
now he was being stretched in passive helplessness
on the rack of Time.</p>

<p>After an &aelig;on of waiting, the doctor left the sick-room
and closed the door noiselessly behind him.
Rivi&egrave;re looked him square in the eye.</p>

<p>"I want the truth," he said in French. The
words sounded as though his throat had closed in
tight around them.</p>

<p>"We must wait until the morning before it will
be possible that we may say definitely," replied the
doctor.</p>

<p>"To say if&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"If we can save the right eye."</p>

<p>"The left?"</p>

<p>"I greatly fear&mdash;&mdash;" A slight gesture of his
two hands completed the sentence.</p>

<p>"It's ghastly! That <i>beast</i>&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"But you must not despair," continued the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
doctor in an endeavour to be optimistic. "Madame
is strong and healthy. She has a very sound constitution,
and in such a case as this it is a most
important factor in the recovery. You may rely
on me to do my utmost. I have great hopes that
we may save the right eye of madame, your wife."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," corrected Rivi&egrave;re mechanically.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," amended the doctor with a
formal little bow.</p>

<p>"You will come again later to-night?"</p>

<p>"That would serve no useful purpose. I have
injected a large dose of morphine, and mademoiselle
is on the point of sleep. I have left full instructions
with the Sister, and if anything unforeseen occurs,
she will communicate with me by telephone."</p>

<p>"I have a further question to ask you, doctor.
Mademoiselle Verney is alone in N&icirc;mes. She has
no friends here beyond myself, and she has been
staying at the Hotel de Provence while passing
through the town. Would it be better for her to
be at the hotel, or at the town hospital, or here?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;decidedly!" answered the doctor.
"Mme Giras is kindness itself&mdash;I know her well.
I recommend that mademoiselle stay here."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re could do nothing but wait the verdict of
the morning, tortured by hopes and fears. The
doctor had spoken of saving the right eye, but was
this mere professional optimism?</p>

<p>Suppose Elaine were blinded for life&mdash;blinded on
his account. What was she to do for her livelihood?
He knew that she was an orphan; that her relations
were repellant to her; and her pride could scarcely
let her throw herself for long on the hospitality of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
her friends in Paris. Her slender means would
soon be exhausted&mdash;what was she to do then?</p>

<p>With overwhelming conviction Rivi&egrave;re saw the
inevitable solution. She had been blinded while
trying to save him. The debt, the overwhelming
debt, lay on him. He must provide for her, guard
over her.</p>

<p>If she would accept such help....</p>

<p>In the cold grey of a mist-shrouded morning he
woke with a new insistent thought hammering into
his brain. For the first time since he had taken up
the personality of John Rivi&egrave;re, doubt surged upon
him in wave after wave of icy, sullen surf. Had he
had the right to cut loose from the life of Clifford
Matheson? Had one alone of a married couple
the right to decide on such a separation? Had he
violated some unwritten law of Fate, and was this
the hand of Fate punishing him through the woman
he cared for more deeply than he had yet confessed
to himself?</p>

<p>He knew now that from the first moment of their
meeting by the arena of Arles she had opened within
him&mdash;against his volition&mdash;a whole realm of inner
feelings which up till then had lain dormant. He
had wanted no woman in this new life of his, and
both at Arles and at N&icirc;mes he had tried to shut and
bolt the gate of the secret realm. Sincerely he had
wanted to give his whole thoughts and energies to
his future work, but here was something which persisted
in his inner consciousness against his will.
It was like curtaining the windows and shutting
one's eyes against a storm&mdash;in spite of barriers the
lightning slashes through to the retina of the eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Was Fate to punish him through the woman he
loved?</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re rose with determination and flung the
thought aside. "Fate" was only a bogey to
frighten children with. "Fate" was a coward's
master. Every man had the right to rough-hew his
own life. He, Rivi&egrave;re, had chosen his new life with
eyes open, and, right or wrong, he would stick by
his choice and hew out his life on his own lines.
If "Fate" were indeed a reality, then he would
fight it as he had fought Lars Larssen. He would
unknot the tangled threads at whatever cost to
himself.</p>

<p>The doctor looked very grave when he had left
Elaine's bedside the next morning.</p>

<p>"The injuries are very serious," he told Rivi&egrave;re.
"The cornea of the right eye has almost been destroyed
by the acid. It will heal over, but the sight
will not be as it was before."</p>

<p>"You mean blinded for life&mdash;in both eyes?"
asked Rivi&egrave;re, ruthless for his own feelings.</p>

<p>"We must not hope for too much," hedged the
doctor. "A great deal depends on the course of
the recovery. I wish not to raise false hopes...."</p>

<p>"You must pardon what I am going to say,
doctor. I have every confidence in your skill,
but is it not possible that the help of an
eye specialist from Paris or Lyons might be of
service?"</p>

<p>The doctor put false dignity aside and answered
sympathetically: "You are right, monsieur, a
specialist <i>is</i> needed. As soon as mademoiselle can
stand the long journey, I would advise that she be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
taken to Wiesbaden, to the very greatest specialist
in the world."</p>

<p>"You mean Hegelmann?"</p>

<p>"None other."</p>

<p>"It would not be possible for him to travel to
here?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head decisively. "Only for
kings does he travel. He has too many patients in
his surgical home at Wiesbaden who need him daily."</p>

<p>"When will mademoiselle be able to make the
journey?"</p>

<p>"Within the week, I hope."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Information of the attack had of course been
given to the police, who were hot on the trail of the
youth Crau. Meanwhile the local papers sent their
reporters to interview Rivi&egrave;re. He was too well
accustomed to the ways of pressmen to refuse an
interview. He received them and replied with the
very briefest facts of the case, explaining that he
wished to avoid publicity so far as it was possible.
He asked them at all events to leave out names,
as French journals will sometimes do, on request.</p>

<p>Amongst the callers was an Englishman who sent
in word that he was a local correspondent for the
<i>Europe Chronicle</i>. Rivi&egrave;re had him shown into
the garden of the villa, to the arbour. The would-be
interviewer was a man of thirty, quiet and secretive
looking, with a heavy dark moustache curtaining the
expression of his lips. "Morris Sylvester" was the
name on his card.</p>

<p>He carried a hand-camera, which he placed on a
seat beside him and pointed it towards the path<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
from the house. As Rivi&egrave;re approached, Sylvester's
left hand was fingering the silent release of the instantaneous
shutter. He had made a practice of
working his camera surreptitiously while his eyes
held the eyes of his subject.</p>

<p>"Mr Sylvester," began Rivi&egrave;re, "I want to ask
you a favour, as one Englishman to another.
Publicity is extremely distasteful to the lady who
has been so terribly injured. To have her story
spread broadcast for the satisfaction of idle curiosity
would only add to her sufferings. Isn't it possible
for you to suppress this story?"</p>

<p>Sylvester looked hesitant. "I am sincerely sorry
for the lady," he said. "But of course I have my
duty to my journal. I had intended to wire a full
column, and take a picture of the scene of the
attack by the Druids' Tower." He took up his
camera from the seat beside him, as though to show
his purpose.</p>

<p>After a moment of reflection he added: "Would
it satisfy you if I were to suppress names?"</p>

<p>"I would much rather you wrote nothing at all,"
replied Rivi&egrave;re. "I know that I can't insist. I
appeal to your generosity in the matter."</p>

<p>"Very well. Under the circumstances, in deference
to the feelings of your friend, I'll take it on
myself to suppress the story."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you. Is there no form of
<i>quid pro quo</i>...?" suggested Rivi&egrave;re tentatively.</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"You'll take something with me before you go?"</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Over the glasses Sylvester chatted pleasantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
about matter of no import, and then brought the
conversation round to the real object of his visit&mdash;to
get certain information for Lars Larssen.</p>

<p>"Your name seems familiar to me, somehow," he
ventured. "Aren't you a scientist, Mr Rivi&egrave;re?"</p>

<p>"I do a little private research work," was the
guarded admission.</p>

<p>"I seem to associate your name with that of
Clifford Matheson, the financier."</p>

<p>"My half-brother."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it.... A very remarkable man. I
had the pleasure of interviewing him once, at his
office in the Rue Lafitte."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re knew that for a lie. He had never seen
Sylvester before, to his knowledge, and he had a
keen memory for faces. What was the man driving
at? He must try and discover. With his
long years of business training behind him, Rivi&egrave;re
became suddenly expansive, talking with apparent
frankness without in reality saying anything of
import.</p>

<p>"As you say, a remarkable man. That is, as a
financier. Personally I have no interests in that
direction. My brother and I have very little in
common. He is the man of affairs, and I am buried
in my work. What was the subject of your interview
with him?"</p>

<p>"Canada's future. He gave me a splendid interview&mdash;first-rate
copy," lied Sylvester. "Have you
seen your brother lately? Is he engaged on any
big scheme just now? Perhaps you could put me
on to a news story in that direction? I should be
glad if you could."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re knew that Sylvester was fishing for information
of some kind, but what it was puzzled
him completely, unless the man were now speaking
the truth in his statement that he was on the
look-out for financial news. That seemed the only
solution of the puzzle.</p>

<p>"I've seen nothing of my brother lately," answered
Rivi&egrave;re. "He's at Monte Carlo, I believe. I'm
sorry not to be able to help you in the matter, but,
as I said before, I'm very little interested in my
brother's movements or plans. His ways and mine
lie apart. If I hear of anything that might be of
service to you, I'll let you know. Will you give me
your address?"</p>

<p>"Hotel de la Poste will find me. I travel about
the Midi for the <i>Chronicle</i>. They'll send on any
message for me at the hotel."</p>

<p>"Many thanks for your kindness in the matter
of suppressing the story of the attack," said Rivi&egrave;re,
and his tone intimated that it was now time for the
visitor to leave.</p>

<p>Sylvester, having gained the objects of his visit,
rose and took his departure. Inside half-an-hour he
had developed an excellent snap-shot of Rivi&egrave;re
walking along the garden path towards him. He
wrote a long letter to Lars Larssen explaining that
John Rivi&egrave;re apparently knew nothing of the disappearance
of Clifford Matheson, and detailing the
story of Elaine and the vitriol outrage.</p>

<p>With the letter he enclosed a bromide print of the
snapshot.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Inside a room, closely shuttered to keep out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
light, Rivi&egrave;re was talking earnestly with Elaine a
few days later. The agony of the first days had
died down, but she was absolutely helpless. Her
eyes were bandaged, and she was dependent on the
sister of mercy and Mme Giras for everything.</p>

<p>"Crau is in prison," said he. "I've given formal
evidence against him, and he is remanded for trial
a month hence. When you are well again, they will
take your evidence on commission. He will undoubtedly
be sentenced to hard labour for some
years."</p>

<p>"What does it matter to me&mdash;now?" There
was despair in her voice.</p>

<p>"The doctor is very hopeful for you, if you will
put yourself under Hegelmann's care."</p>

<p>"He can do nothing for me, I feel it. Only useless
expense. No man can give me back the sight I
want for my work."</p>

<p>"In time," said Rivi&egrave;re gently, but he could not
force conviction into his voice. It went hard with
him to lie to the woman he cared for most in the
world, even to bring temporary comfort to her.</p>

<p>"My work. Barr&egrave;ze and the Od&eacute;on," she murmured
slowly, speaking to herself rather than to
him. "My work was my life. I remember your
saying to me in the garden, by the arbour, only a
few days ago: 'If Fate were to deny you your
freedom!' I shivered even at the words.... Do
you believe in Fate?"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re's fist was clenched as he answered: "I'll
fight Fate for both of us."</p>

<p>She was silent for a few moments. Then she
asked: "Will you write a letter for me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>He brought pen and ink, and waited for her
dictation.</p>

<p>"My dear Barr&egrave;ze," she dictated slowly, "you
must find someone else to paint your scenes of
Provence. I am blinded for life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to write that!"</p>

<p>"I am blinded for life," she continued with the
clear tones of one whose mental vision sees the
future unveiled. "They want me to go to Hegelmann
at Wiesbaden. He is a great man, and will
do for me all that surgical skill can do. There will
be an operation&mdash;several, perhaps. It may perhaps
give me a faint gleam of light&mdash;enough to tell light
from darkness and to realize more keenly all that I
have lost. I shall never see the theatre again&mdash;never
paint again. I shall live on the memories of
the past and the bitter thoughts of what might
have been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't write it!" he cried, torn with the pathos
of the words she bade him put to paper.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;of what might have been. My friends of
the theatre must pass out of my life. They can have
no use for a crippled, helpless woman, nor do I wish
to cloud their happiness with my unwanted presence.
Say good-bye to them for me. And you, my dear
Barr&egrave;ze, I would thank for the chance you gave me.
Your encouragement would have had its reward if
I had kept my sight. But it is gone&mdash;gone for
always&mdash;and I am wreckage on the rocks...."</p>

<p>"Elaine, Elaine!" he cried. "You have me by
your side! I ask you to let me devote my life to
you!"</p>

<p>The answer came gently: "I must not accept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
such a sacrifice. You offer it out of pity for me.
Later, you would repent of it. You have your work
to do and your life to live in the open sunshine.... Yet
don't think me ungrateful. I am deeply
grateful. I shall remember what you said out
of pity for me, and treasure it amongst my dearest
thoughts."</p>

<p>"It's not pity, Elaine, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. The accusing hand of
memory had touched him on the shoulder. He had
no right to make any such offer&mdash;it had come from
his heart in passionate sincerity, but it was not his
to give. Olive was still his wife. Disguise it as he
would, he was still Clifford Matheson.</p>

<p>He must leave Elaine to think that pity alone had
moulded his words. To explain to her now the
shackles of circumstance that bound him fast would
be sheer cruelty, for if she knew the whole truth,
she would send him away from her and refuse even
the temporary help he could give her.</p>

<p>For Elaine's sake he must keep silent.</p>

<p>A pause of bitter reflection raised a barrier of
stone between them. When he spoke again, it was
from the other side of the barrier. "At least you
will let me stay by you until you leave Hegelmann's
charge? That I claim.... And I believe he
will be able to do for you much more than you
imagine. He has worked wonders before. He will
do so again. He is the foremost specialist in the
world. All that money can command shall be
yours."</p>

<p>"Money is terribly useless," said Elaine sadly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">ONLY PITY!</span></h2>


<p>What was Elaine to do with her life?</p>

<p>In those weary days of the sick-room
at N&icirc;mes, and on the long railway journey
through Lyons, Besan&ccedil;on and Strasburg to Wiesbaden,
Elaine had turned over and over, in feverishly
restless search for hope, the possibilities that lay
before her.</p>

<p>Her total capital was comprised in a few hundred
pounds and the furniture of the flat she shared in
Paris with a girl friend&mdash;a student at the Conservatoire.
The money would see her through the
expenses of Dr Hegelmann's nursing home and for
a few months afterwards&mdash;a year at the outside.
After that she must inevitably be dependent on the
charity of friends or on some charitable institution.</p>

<p>The thought of the time when her capital would
be gone was like an icy hand gripping at her heart.
"Money is terribly useless," she had said to Rivi&egrave;re,
but there were times when she wished passionately
that she had the money with which to buy comforts
for a life of blindness. Those were craven moments,
however&mdash;moments which she despised when they
were past. Of what use to her would be the silken-padded
cage she had longed to buy, when life held
for her no work, no love?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re she had thought of a thousand times.
His every action and word in the days of their first
acquaintanceship came back to her with the wonderful
inner clarity of sight and hearing that belongs
to those who have no outer vision.</p>

<p>She saw him at the arena of Arles, standing on
the topmost tier a few yards distant from her,
watching the red ball of the sun sink down into the
mists of the grey Camargue. He was aloof and cold&mdash;icy,
unapproachable, masked in reserve.</p>

<p>She saw him in the <i>ruelle</i> of Arles, with the light
from the shuttered window falling on him in bars
of yellow and black, fighting with Berserk fury
against the bare knife of the Proven&ccedil;al youth.
Here he was primitive man unchained&mdash;a Rodin
figure with muscles knotted in a riot of hot-blooded
passion. He was battling for her.</p>

<p>No, not for her, but for the duty that a man owes
to womankind. "I didn't even know it was you,"
he had said curtly. That had hurt her at the time,
but now it seared into her. The rescue had meant
nothing&mdash;it had brought him no nearer to her. He
was still cold and aloof.</p>

<p>She saw him in the Jardin de la Fontaine,
lifting his hat with formal politeness and making
to move on. Still aloof, still encased in cold
reserve.</p>

<p>With deliberate intent she had set herself to melt
him, and she had succeeded. By the arbour of the
Villa Cl&eacute;mentine she saw him, chatting animatedly
in keen enjoyment of her frank camaraderie. But
that was only casual friendship. Still aloof in what
now mattered vitally to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>She saw him seeking her out by the Maison Carr&eacute;e,
standing to watch her sketch and passing to her the
compliment of candid praise. Then he had come
nearer, but by such a little!</p>

<p>She saw him silvered in the moonlight by the
Druids' Tower, standing at her easel. Here he
would surely have revealed himself if he had had
thoughts to utter of inner feelings. But he had
remained silent.</p>

<p>Then there rang in her ears his passionate declaration
of the sick-room: "Elaine! Elaine! You
have me by your side! I ask you to let me devote
my life to you!"</p>

<p>She weighed it scrupulously in the balance of
reason, and judged it Pity. It was the hasty
word of a chivalrous man torn by the sight of
her helplessness. If it had been love, he would
not have been stopped by her refusal. Love is
insistent, headstrong, ruthless of obstacles. Love
would have forced his offer upon her again
and again. Love would have divined the doubt
in her mind. Love would have drowned it in
kisses.</p>

<p>It was not Love but Pity that Rivi&egrave;re felt for her.
And while she silently thanked him for it, it was
not enough. She would not encumber the life of a
man who felt merely Pity for her. That would be
degradation worse than the acceptance of public
charity.</p>

<p>Out of all the turmoil of her fevered thoughts
there came this one conclusion: when her last
money had been spent, when there only remained
for her the bitter bread of charity, she would pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
quietly out of life to a world where the outer sight
would matter nothing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, every casual word of Rivi&egrave;re's was
weighed and re-weighed, tested and assayed by her
for the gold that might be hidden within.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">RIVI&Egrave;RE IS CALLED BACK</span></h2>


<p>There are two sides to Wiesbaden. The
one is with the gay, cosmopolitan life
that saunters along the Wilhelmstrasse and
dallies with the allurements of the most enticing
shops in Germany; suns itself in the gardens of the
Kursaal or on the wind-sheltered slopes of the
Neroberg; listens to an orchestra of master-artists
in the open or to a prima donna in the brilliance of
the opera-house; dines, wines, gambles, dissipates,
burns the lamp of life under forced draught.</p>

<p>The other side is with the life behind the curtains
of the nursing homes, where dim flickers of life and
health are jealously watched and tended. Wiesbaden
is both a Bond Street and a Harley Street.
Specialists in medicine and surgery have their
consulting rooms a few doors away from those of
specialists in jewellery, flowers or confectionery.
Their names and their specialities are prominent on
door-plates almost as though they were competing
against the lures of the traders.</p>

<p>But Dr Hegelmann had no need to cry his services
in the market-place. His consulting rooms and
nursing home were hidden amongst the evergreens
of a cool, restful garden well away from the flaunting
life of the Wilhelmstrasse. By the door his name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and titles were inscribed in inconspicuous lettering
on a small black marble tablet. His specialty needed
no proclaiming.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re found the great surgeon curiously uncouth
in appearance. His brown, grey-streaked beard was
longer than customary and ragged in outline; his
eyebrows projected like a sea-captain's; his almost
bald head seemed to be stretched tight over a framework
of knobs and bumps; his clothes were baggy
and shapeless. But all these unessentials faded
away from sight when Dr Hegelmann spoke. His
voice was wonderfully compelling&mdash;a voice tuned
to a sympathy all-embracing. His voice could make
even German sound musical. And his hands were
the hands of a musician.</p>

<p>Before bringing Elaine into the consulting-room,
Rivi&egrave;re explained the facts of the vitriol outrage,
gave into his hands the letter of advice from the
doctor at N&icirc;mes, and then broached the subject of
payment. They spoke in German, because Dr
Hegelmann had steadfastly refused to learn any
language beyond his own. All his energies of learning
had been focused on his one specialty.</p>

<p>"I want to explain," said Rivi&egrave;re, "that Fra&uuml;lein
Verney is not well-to-do. She is, I believe, practically
dependent on her profession."</p>

<p>"Then we shall adjust the scale of payment to
whatever she can afford," answered the doctor
readily. "I value my rich patients only because
they can pay me for my poorer patients."</p>

<p>"Many thanks. But that was not quite my
meaning. I want to ask you to charge her at the
lowest rate, and allow me to make up the difference."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Without letting her know it."</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"That shall be as you wish. I appreciate your
motives." His voice was full of sympathy, giving
a treble value to the most ordinary words. "That
is the action of a true friend."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re brought Elaine into the consulting-room,
and left her in the great specialist's gentle hands.
An assistant surgeon was there to act as interpreter.</p>

<p>The verdict came quickly. For a week Elaine
was to be in the surgical home receiving preliminary
treatment, and then Dr Hegelmann was to operate
on her right eye. For the left eye there was no
hope.</p>

<p>During the week of waiting, Rivi&egrave;re came twice a
day to Elaine's bedside, to chat and read to her.</p>

<p>One day he told her that he had arranged for the
use of a bench at a private biological laboratory
at Wiesbaden belonging to one of the medical
specialists.</p>

<p>"That will enable me to begin my research while
you're recovering from the operation. You'll have
no need to think that you might be keeping me here
away from my work."</p>

<p>"I'm glad. It's very good to have a friend by
one, but I should have worried at keeping you from
your work. Now I'm relieved.... Is the laboratory
here well equipped?"</p>

<p>"Quite sufficiently for my purposes. Of course
I'm sending to Paris for my own microscope&mdash;it's a
Zeiss, with a one-twelfth oil immersion&mdash;and I'll
have my own rocker microtome sent over also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
There's a microtome in the laboratory here, but I
might take weeks to get on terms with it. If you'd
ever worked with the instrument, you'd know how
curiously human it is in its moods and whims. If a
microtome takes a liking to you, she'll work herself
to the bone while you merely rest your hand on the
lever. But if she has some secret objection to you,
she'll pout and sulk, and jib and rear, and generally
try to drive you distracted."</p>

<p>Elaine smiled. "I notice that man always applies
the feminine gender to anything unreliable in the
way of machinery. If it's sober and steady-going,
you label it masculine, like Big Ben. But if it's
uncertain in action, like a motor-boat, you call it
Fifi or Lolo or Vivienne."</p>

<p>"That's a true bill," confessed Rivi&egrave;re. "Henceforth
I'll keep to the strictly neutral 'it' when I
mention a microtome."</p>

<p>"I want to know the nature of your research
work. You've never yet told me except in vague,
general terms."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re hesitated. It seemed to him scarcely a
subject to discuss with one who herself was in the
hands of the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you prefer a more cheerful topic?"
he ventured.</p>

<p>Elaine appreciated the reason for his hesitation,
and answered: "I want to hear of the spirit behind
your technicalities. It won't depress me in the
least. Please go on."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re began to explain to her the big idea which
he was hoping to develop in the coming years.
He avoided any details that might seem to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
even a remote personal bearing. He spoke with
enthusiasm&mdash;his voice became aglow with inner fire.
And it was clear from her attitude and from the
questions she interjected from time to time that she
realized the value of his idea, appreciated his motives,
and was whole-heartedly interested in what he was
telling her.</p>

<p>As Elaine listened, a tiny voice within her was
whispering: "Here is your rival." And she felt
glad that her rival was one of high purpose. The
call of science and a high, impersonal aim, touched
her as something sacred.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re had brought with him a daily paper&mdash;the
Frankfort edition of the <i>Europe Chronicle</i>&mdash;in
order to read it to her. Thinking that she might
be getting wearied of his personal affairs, he broke
off presently, and with her agreement, opened the
paper at the news pages, calling out the headlines
until she intimated a wish to hear a fuller reading.</p>

<p>He had finished the news pages for her, and was
about to put the paper aside, when the instinct of
long habit made him glance at the headlines of the
financial page.</p>

<p>Elaine heard a sudden decisive rustle of the paper
as he folded it quickly, and then came a minute of
silence which carried to her sensitive brain a strange
sensation of tenseness.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked. "Won't you read it
out?"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re's voice had altered completely when he
answered her. There was now a reserved, constrained
note in it. "An item of news which
touches me personally," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I not to hear it?"</p>

<p>"I would rather you didn't ask me."</p>

<p>There was silence again. Rivi&egrave;re sat stiff with
rigid muscles while he thought out the bearings of
the news item he had just read. Then he asked her
to excuse him on a matter of immediate urgency.</p>

<p>At the post office he managed after some waiting
to get telephonic communication with the Frankfort
office of the <i>Europe Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>"Tell the financial editor that Mr John Rivi&egrave;re
wants to speak to him," he said authoritatively.
"Please put me through quickly. I'm on a trunk
wire."</p>

<p>After a pause the stereotyped reply came that the
financial editor was out. His assistant was now
speaking, and would take any message. Clifford
Matheson would not have had such an answer made
to him, but Rivi&egrave;re was an unknown name. He
realized that he must now cool his heels in anterooms,
and communicate with chiefs through the
medium of their subordinates.</p>

<p>"You have an item in to-day's paper regarding
the forthcoming notation of Hudson Bay Transport,
Ltd. Mr Clifford Matheson's name is mentioned as
Chairman. I should very much like to know if you
have had confirmation of that item, and from where
it was obtained."</p>

<p>"Hold the line, please. I'll make enquiries."</p>

<p>Presently the answer came. "Why do you wish
to know?"</p>

<p>"Mr Matheson is my half-brother, and though I'm
in close touch with him, I've had no intimation of
any such move on his part."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold the line, please."</p>

<p>Another pause ensued, followed by the formal
statement. "The news came to us last night from
our Paris office. We believe it to be correct. Do
we understand that you wish to deny it?"</p>

<p>"No; I want to get confirmation of it. Thanks&mdash;good-bye."</p>

<p>Then he asked the post-office for a trunk call to
Paris, and after an hour's wait he was put in touch
with the headquarters of the <i>Europe Chronicle</i>.
The second 'phone conversation proved as unsatisfactory
as the first. A financial editor of a
responsible journal does not talk freely with any
unknown man who rings him up on a hasty trunk
call. The reply came that the information in
question reached the paper from a perfectly reliable
source. If Mr Rivi&egrave;re cared to call at the office,
they would give him proof of the accuracy of their
statement. They could not discuss such a matter
over the 'phone.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re urged that he was speaking from Wiesbaden.</p>

<p>They were sorry, but they did not care to discuss
the matter over the 'phone. He must either take
their word for it that the information was correct,
or else call in person at the Paris office.</p>

<p>It was clear to Rivi&egrave;re that he must make the
journey to Paris if he were to unravel the mystery
of that astounding statement. The dead Clifford
Matheson mentioned authoritatively as Chairman
of the new company! Why should such an impossible
story be set afloat, and what was the "reliable
source" spoken of? He knew that the <i>Europe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Chronicle</i> though a sensational paper, would not
print self-invented fiction on its financial page.</p>

<p>"I have an urgent call to Paris," he told Elaine. "I
hope you will excuse my running away so brusquely?
I'll be back before the day of your operation."</p>

<p>"Of course, I excuse you," she replied readily.
"I know that something very important is calling
you. And in any case, what right would I have to
say yes or no to a private decision of your own?"</p>

<p>There leapt in her a sudden hope that he would
answer from the heart. But his reply held nothing
beyond a bare statement. "This matter is extremely
urgent. I propose to catch a night train to Paris
and be back by to-morrow evening. Is there anything
I can do for you before I go?"</p>

<p>"I have everything ... but my sight."</p>

<p>"And that, Dr Hegelmann will give you within
the month!" he affirmed.</p>

<p>In Paris early the next morning, Rivi&egrave;re sought
out the financial editor of the <i>Europe Chronicle</i>.
At a face-to-face interview, Rivi&egrave;re's personality
impressed, and the newspaper man showed himself
quite willing to prove the <i>bona fides</i> of his journal.</p>

<p>"If you will step into the adjoining room," he
said, "I'll send you the reporter who brought us
the information. Ask him any questions you like.
I've perfect confidence in him, and I stand by any
statement of his we print. I don't think people
realize how careful we are on financial matters&mdash;they
seem to think that a popular paper will print
any sort of <i>canard</i> offhand."</p>

<p>There followed Rivi&egrave;re into the next room a tubby
rosy-faced little man, brisk and smiling. "Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
sir, what can I do for you?" he rattled off cheerfully.
"The financial editor tells me that I'm to preach to
you the gospel of the infallibility of the <i>Chronicle</i>.
What's the particular text you're heaving bricks at?"</p>

<p>Jimmy Martin's infectious good-humour brought
an answering smile from Rivi&egrave;re. "I'm not casting
doubts on the modern-day Bible," he replied. "I'm
seeking information. I want to know who told you
that Clifford Matheson, my half-brother, is to head
the Board of Hudson Bay Transport, Ltd."</p>

<p>"I have it straight from the stable&mdash;from Lars
Larssen."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re's face did not move a muscle&mdash;he was still
smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Larssen and I are old pals," continued Martin
briskly. "So when he was passing through Paris
the other day he 'phoned me to the effect of come
and crack a bottle with me, come and let's reminisce
together over the good old days. I went; and he
gave me the juicy little piece of news you saw in
yesterday's rag. We saved up some of it for to-day&mdash;have
you seen? Clifford Matheson heads the
festal board, and the other revellers at the guinea-feast
are the Right Hon. Lord St Aubyn, Sir Francis
Letchmere, Bart., and G. Lowndes Hawley Carleton-Wingate,
M.P. Lars Larssen sits below the salt&mdash;to
wit, joins the Board after allotment. The capital
is to be a cool five million, and if I were a prophet
I'd tell you whether they'll get it or not."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;that's just what I wanted to know."</p>

<p>"You withdraw the bricks?"</p>

<p>"Unreservedly.... By the way, do you know
where my brother is at the moment?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vague idea he's in Canada. Don't know where
I get it from. Those sort of things are floating in
the air."</p>

<p>"Where is Larssen?"</p>

<p>"He was going on to London&mdash;dear old foggy,
fried-fishy London! Ever notice that London is
ringed around with the smell of fried fish and
naphtha of an evening? The City smells of caretakers;
and Piccadilly of patchouli; and the West
End of petrol; but the smell of fish fried in tenth-rate
oil in little side-streets rings them around and
bottles them up. In Paris it's wood-smoke and
roast coffee, and I daresay heaps healthier, but I
sigh me for the downright odours of old England!
Imitaciong poetry&mdash;excuse this display of emotion."</p>

<p>When Rivi&egrave;re left the office of the journal on the
Boulevard des Italiens, he made his way rapidly to
No. 8 Rue Laffitte, second floor. There he inquired
for Clifford Matheson, and was informed that the
financier was in Winnipeg.</p>

<p>"You're certain of that?" asked Rivi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>"Quite, sir!" answered the clerk in surprise.
"We get cables from him giving addresses to send
letters to. If you'd like anything forwarded, sir,
leave it here and we shall attend to it."</p>

<p>It was now clear beyond doubt that Lars Larssen
was playing a game of unparalleled audacity. He
had somehow arranged to impersonate the "dead"
Clifford Matheson, and was using the impersonation
to float the Hudson Bay scheme on his own
lines.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re flushed with anger at the realization of
how Lars Larssen was using his name.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>But that was a trifle compared with the main
issue. When he had fought Lars Larssen, it was
not a mere petty squabble over a division of loot.
The Hudson Bay scheme was no mere commercial
machine for grinding out a ten per cent. profit. If
successful, it meant an entire re-organization of the
wheat traffic between Canada and Great Britain.
It meant, in kernel, the control of Britain's bread-supply.
It affected directly fifty millions of his
fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>For that reason Rivi&egrave;re had refused to lend his
name to a scheme under which Lars Larssen would
hold the reins of control. He knew the ruthlessness
of the man and his overweening lust of power,
which had passed the bounds of ordinary ambition
and had become a Napoleonic egomania.</p>

<p>In refusing to act on the Board, Rivi&egrave;re had made
an altruistic decision. But now the same problem
confronted him again in a different guise. If he
remained silent, the scheme would in all probability
be floated in his name to a successful issue. If he
remained silent, he would be betraying fifty millions
of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>He had thought to strike out from the whirlpool
into peaceful waters, but the whirlpool was sucking
him back.</p>

<p>Weighing duty against duty, he saw clearly that
he must at once confront Larssen and crumple up
his daring scheme. And so he wired to Elaine:</p>

<p>"An urgent affair calls me to London. Shall
return to you at the earliest possible moment.
Address, Avon Hotel, Lincoln's Inn Fields."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">NOT WANTED!</span></h2>


<p>In the train Calaiswards, Rivi&egrave;re felt as though
he had just plunged into an ice-cold lake fed by
torrents from the snow-peaks, and had emerged
tingling in every fibre with the glow of health.</p>

<p>The course before him was straight; the issue
clean-cut. He had only to confront Lars Larssen to
bring the latter to his knees. If there were opposition,
the threat of a public prosecution would brush
it aside.</p>

<p>He must resume the personality of Clifford
Matheson; return to Olive; settle a generous income
on Elaine. He must wind up his financial
affairs and devote himself to the scientific research
he had planned.</p>

<p>A straight, clean course.</p>

<p>He looked forward eagerly to the moment when he
would walk into Larssen's private office and smash
a fist through his hoped-for control of Hudson Bay.
Until that moment, he would keep outwardly to the
identity of John Rivi&egrave;re. But already he was
feeling himself back in the personality of Clifford
Matheson&mdash;the hard, firm lines had set again around
his mouth, the look of masterfulness was in his eye.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Channel was in its sullen mood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Overhead, skies were grey with ragged, shapeless
cloud; below, the waters were the colour of slag
and slapping angrily against the plates of the starboard
bow under the drive of a wind from the
north-east. The ashen cliffs of Dover came to meet
the packet reluctant and inhospitable. By the
harbour-entrance, a petulant squall of rain beat
upon them as though to shoo them away. The
landing-stage was slippery and slimy with rain,
soot, and petrol drippings from the motor-cars
shipped to and fro. Customs-house officers eyed
them with tired suspicion; porters took their
money and hastened away with the curtest of
acknowledgments; an engine panted sullenly as it
waited for never-ending mail-bags to be hauled up
from the bowels of the packets and dumped into the
mail-van.</p>

<p>England had no welcome for Rivi&egrave;re at her front
door.</p>

<p>Through the Weald of Kent, where spring comes
early, this April afternoon showed the land still
naked and cold. On the coppices, dispirited catkins
drooped their tassels from the wet branches
of the undergrowth, but the young leaves lurked
within their brown coverings as though they shivered
at the thought of venturing out into the bleak air.
On the oaks, dead leaves from the past autumn
clung obstinately to their mother-branches. The
hop-lands were a dreary drab; hop-poles huddled
against one another for warmth; streams ran
swollen and muddy and rebellious.</p>

<p>"The Garden of England" had no welcome for
Rivi&egrave;re.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>They swerved through Tonbridge Junction,
glistening sootily under a drizzle of rain, and dived
into the yawning tunnel of River Hill as though
into refuge from the bleakness of the open country.
Two fellow-travellers with Rivi&egrave;re were discussing
the gloomy outlook of a threatened railway strike
which rumbled through the daily papers like
distant thunder. Fragment of talk came to his
ears:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Minimum wage.... Damned insolence.... Tie
up the whole country.... Have them all
flogged to work.... Not a statesman in the
House.... Weak-kneed set of vote-snatchers.... If
I had my way...."</p>

<p>The train ran them roof-high through endless
vistas of the mean grey streets of south-east London,
where the street-lamps were beginning to throw out
a yellow haze against the murky drizzle of the late
afternoon; slowed to a crawl in obedience to the
raised arms of imperious signals; stopped over
viaducts for long wearisome minutes while flaunting
sky-signs drummed into the passengers the superabundant
merits of Somebody's Whisky or Somebodyelse's
Soap.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour late at the terminus, Rivi&egrave;re had
his valise sent to the Avon Hotel, hailed a taxi, and
told the man to drive as fast as possible to Leadenhall
Street. In that narrow canon of commerce
was a large, substantial building bearing the simple
sign&mdash;a sign ostentatious in its simplicity&mdash;of
"Lars Larssen&mdash;Shipping."</p>

<p>"Tell Mr Larssen that Mr John Rivi&egrave;re wishes to
see him," he said to a clerk at the inquiry desk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir, but Mr Larssen left the office not
ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where he went to?"</p>

<p>"If you'll wait a moment, sir, I'll send up an
inquiry to his secretary. What name did you
say?"</p>

<p>"Rivi&egrave;re&mdash;John Rivi&egrave;re. The brother of Mr
Clifford Matheson."</p>

<p>Presently the answer came down the house 'phone
that Mr Larssen had gone to his home in Hampstead.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re re-entered the taxi and gave an address
on the Heath. He wanted to thrash out the matter
with Larssen with the least possible delay. He
would have preferred to confront the shipowner in
his office, but since that plan had miscarried, he
would seek him out in his private house.</p>

<p>Near King's Cross another taxi coming out from
a cross-street skidded as it swerved around the
corner, and jolted into his own with a crash of glass
and a crumple of mudguards. Delay followed while
the two chauffeurs upbraided one another with
crimson epithets, and gave rival versions of the
incident to a gravely impartial policeman. When
Rivi&egrave;re at length reached Hampstead Heath, it was
to find that the shipowner had just left the house.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re explained to the butler that it was very
important he should reach Larssen without delay,
and his personality impressed the servant as that
of a visitor of standing. He therefore told Rivi&egrave;re
what he knew.</p>

<p>"Mr Larssen changed into evening dress, sir, and
went off in his small covered car. I don't know
where he's gone, sir, but he told me if anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
important arose I was to ring him up at P. O.
Richmond, 2882."</p>

<p>That telephone number happened to be quite
familiar to Rivi&egrave;re. It was the number of his own
house at Roehampton.</p>

<p>He jumped into the waiting taxi once again, and
ordered the chauffeur to drive across London to
Barnes Common and Roehampton. If he could
not confront Larssen at office or house, he would
run him to earth that evening in his own home.
No doubt Larssen was going there to talk business
with Sir Francis.</p>

<p>Roehampton is a country village held within the
octopus arms of Greater London. Round it are a
number of large houses with fine, spacious grounds&mdash;country
estates they were when Queen Victoria
ascended the throne of England. At Olive's special
choice, her husband had purchased one of the
mansions and had it re-decorated for her in modern
style. She liked its nearness to London proper&mdash;it
gave her touch with Bond Street and theatreland
in half-an-hour by fast car. She liked its spacious
lawns and its terraced Italian garden&mdash;they were
so admirable for garden parties and open-air
theatricals. She liked the useless size of the house&mdash;it
ministered to her love of opulence.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re had grown to hate it in the last few
years.</p>

<p>The name of the estate was "Thornton Chase."
The approach lay through a winding drive bordered
by giant beeches, and passed one of the box-hedged
lawns to curl before a front door on the further side
of the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>When at the very gates another delay in that
evening of delays occurred. This time it was a
tyre-burst. Rivi&egrave;re, impatient of further waste of
time, paid off the chauffeur and started on foot
along the entrance drive. The drizzle of the afternoon
had ceased, and a few stars shone halfheartedly
through rents in the ragged curtain of
cloud, as though performing a duty against their
will.</p>

<p>When passing through the box-hedged lawn as a
short cut to the front door, one of the curtains of
the lighted drawing-room was suddenly thrown
back, and the broad figure of man stood framed in
a golden panel of light. It was Lars Larssen.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re stopped involuntarily. It was as though
his antagonist had divined his presence and had come
boldly forward to meet him. And, indeed,
that was not far from the fact. Larssen, waiting
alone in the drawing-room, had had one of his strange
intuitive impulses to throw wide the curtain and
look out into the night. Such an impulse he never
opposed. He had learnt by long experience that
there were centres of perception within him, uncharted
by science, which gathered impressions too
vague to put a name to, and yet vitally real. He
always gave rein to his intuition and let it lead him
where it chose.</p>

<p>Looking out into the night, the shipowner could
not see Rivi&egrave;re, who had stopped motionless in the
shadow of a giant box clipped to the shape of a
peacock standing on a broad pedestal.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re waited.</p>

<p>Presently Larssen turned abruptly as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
someone had entered the room. A smile of welcome
was on his lips. Olive swept in, close-gowned in
black with silvery scales. She offered her hand with
a radiant smile, and Larssen took it masterfully and
raised it to his lips. Rivi&egrave;re noted that it was not
the shipowner who had moved forward to meet
Olive, but Olive who had come gladly to him.</p>

<p>They stood by the fireplace, and Olive chatted
animatedly to her guest. Rivi&egrave;re scarcely recognized
his wife in this transformation of spirit.
With him she was cold and abrupt, and captious,
eyes half-lidded and cheeks white and mask-like.
Now her eyes flashed and sparkled, and there was
warm colour in her cheeks.</p>

<p>Of what Olive and Larssen said to one another,
no word came to Rivi&egrave;re. But attitude and gesture
told him more than words could have done. It was
as though he were a spectator of a bioscope drama,
standing in darkness while a scene was being pictured
for him in remorseless detail behind the lighted
window. That Olive's feeling for Larssen had
grown beyond mere friendship was plain beyond
question. She was infatuated with the man; and
he was playing with her infatuation.</p>

<p>For a moment Rivi&egrave;re's fist clenched; then his
fingers loosened, and he watched without stirring.
Larssen must, in view of his action on the Hudson
Bay coup, believe Matheson to be dead. To him,
Olive was now a widow. Therefore Rivi&egrave;re had no
quarrel with the shipowner on the ground of what he
was now witnessing. His desire to crumple Larssen
in the hollow of his hand and fling him into the mud
at his feet was based on very different grounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, Olive must believe Matheson
to be alive. Larssen would have told her that her
husband was away in Canada on business for a few
weeks, and he would keep up the fiction until the
Hudson Bay scheme were floated to a public
issue.</p>

<p>That Rivi&egrave;re could watch the scene pictured before
him without stirring&mdash;could watch in silence the
spectacle of his wife's infatuation for another man&mdash;might
seem superficially as the height of cynical
cold-bloodedness. Yet nothing could be farther
from the truth. Rivi&egrave;re was a man of very deep
and very strong feelings held habitually under a
rigid control. Self-control is very often mistaken
superficially for cold-bloodedness, just as heartiness
is mistaken for big-heartedness.</p>

<p>He was balanced enough to hold no blame
for Olive. Within two years of marriage he had
plumbed her to the depths. It was not in her to
be more than a reckless spender of other people's
money and other people's lives. She was born to
waste just as another is born to create. The way
in which she was throwing herself at Larssen during
his absence for a few weeks was typical of her inborn
character, which nothing could uproot.</p>

<p>It was clear beyond doubt that Olive did not want
him back. She preferred him out of her way. If
he could disappear for ever, leaving his fortune in
her hands, she would unquestionably be glad of it.
What he had in fact brought about by taking up
the personality of John Rivi&egrave;re was what she seemed
most to desire.</p>

<p>He was coming home as an intruder. Even in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
own house there would be no welcome for him.
<i>He was not wanted.</i></p>

<p>There was a sudden stiffening on the part of Olive,
as though she heard someone about to enter the
room. Sir Francis came in, shook hands cordially
with Larssen, and all three made their way to
dinner.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re was left looking into an empty room.
With sudden decision he made his way out of the
grounds of Thornton Chase. He would see the
shipowner to-morrow in his office at Leadenhall
Street rather than thrash out the coming quarrel in
front of Olive and Sir Francis.</p>

<p>His duty lay in taking up once more the role of
Clifford Matheson and returning to Olive's side.
Though what he had seen that evening made the
duty trebly distasteful, he must carry it out to the
end. Yet to himself he was glad of the short respite.
For one night more he would breathe freedom as
John Rivi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>Only one night more!</p>

<p>For the moment, time was no object to him, and
he proceeded on foot through Roehampton village
and by the sodden coppices of Putney Heath to the
Portsmouth high road and the railway station of
East Putney.</p>

<p>He waited at the station until an underground
train snaked its way in like a giant blindworm, and
went with it to the Temple and so to the quiet
hotel he had chosen in Lincoln's Inn Fields. On
his way, he sent off a telegram to the shipowner
stating that John Rivi&egrave;re would call at Leadenhall
Street at eleven o'clock in the morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>In the coffee-room of the Avon Hotel he sat down
to write a long letter to Elaine which would explain
all that had been hidden from her. Without
sparing himself one jot he told her of the circumstances
of his life since the crucial night of March
14th, and of the deception he carried out with her
as well as with the rest of the world. It was long
past midnight before he put to the letter the signature
of "Clifford Matheson."</p>

<p>And then with a stab of pain he remembered that
Elaine could not read it. There were passages in
the letter which must not be read to her by any
outside person. It was evident that what he had
to tell her would have to be said by word of mouth.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re tore up his letter into small fragments
and burnt them carefully in the grate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">A THRONE-ROOM</span></h2>


<p>Dinner was over at Thornton Chase, and
the three were back in the drawing-room&mdash;Olive,
Larssen, and Sir Francis. The men
smoked at Olive's request; and she herself lighted
one of a special brand of cigarettes which she had
made for her by Antonides.</p>

<p>"I hate to have my drawing-room smelling of
afternoon-tea and feminine chit-chat," she explained.
"The two Carleton-Wingate frumps called
on me this afternoon for a couple of solid hours'
boring, which they dignify to themselves as a duty
call. Please smoke away the remembrance of them."</p>

<p>"The Carleton-Wingates are a useful crowd,"
said Larssen. "There's an M.P., a major-general
and a minister plenipotentiary amongst them."</p>

<p>"Give me those to deal with, and you entertain
the twin frumps," answered Olive. "Twins are
always hateful in a room, because they sit together
and chorus their comments together, just as if they
were one mind with two bodies. You feel as if you
ought to split yourself in two and devote half to
each, so as not to cause jealousy. But twin old
maids are especially hateful."</p>

<p>"A very old family," was Letchmere's comment.
"They go back to Henry VII."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the entertainment for to-night?" asked
Olive of Larssen.</p>

<p>"I propose to take you to the new Cabaret,"
said he.</p>

<p>"First-rate!"</p>

<p>"But it doesn't start until ten-thirty. We've
plenty of time. First, I want you to play to
me."</p>

<p>Olive went over to the piano, and Larssen followed
to light the candles and turn back the case of
polished rosewood inlaid with ivory.</p>

<p>She laid her fingers on the keys and looked up at
him expectantly.</p>

<p>"Something lively," he ordered, and she rattled
into the latest success of the musical comedy stage.
Such as it was, she played it brilliantly. To-night
she was in that morphia mood of the terrace of
Monte Carlo when she had first told him of her
contempt for her husband.</p>

<p>Under cover of the playing, while Sir Francis
was reading a novel of turf life, Olive whispered:
"Can't we have a few moments together by
ourselves?"</p>

<p>"I'll arrange it," answered Larssen.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we drop your father at the Cabaret
while we go on to see my offices?"</p>

<p>"Offices&mdash;at night-time!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"My staff work all night there&mdash;I have a night-shift
as well as a day-shift. In fact, the offices are
busier at night-time than in the day-time."</p>

<p>"Isn't that a very unusual arrangement?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It enables me to deal with routine-work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
while the other fellow's asleep. That's always been
one of my business principles: get to-morrow's
work done to-day; get a twelve hours' start of the
other man."</p>

<p>"How typical of you!"</p>

<p>"My place is thoroughly worth seeing. Suppose
I show you over it?"</p>

<p>Larssen's pride in his office was fully justified.
There was nothing in London, nothing in England
to match it as a perfect business machine. And
there was no private office in Europe which could
compare in impressiveness with Larssen's own.</p>

<p>Things went as he arranged, and from the busy
hive of industry on the ground and first floors he
took Olive to his private room on the second. It
was a room some thirty yards long and broad in
proportion, with a central dome reaching above the
roof. A few broad tables were almost lost in its
immensity. Round the walls were maps dotted
with flag-pins telling of the position of ships. At
the further end was Larssen's own work-table&mdash;a
horseshoe-shaped desk. Above and behind it hung
a portrait of his little boy by Sargent.</p>

<p>"It's almost a throne-room!" was Olive's exclamation
of wonder.</p>

<p>Larssen smiled his pleasure. It <i>was</i> a throne-room.
He had designed it as such. His private
house at Hampstead mattered little to him. His
house on Riverside Drive, New York, and his great
forest estate in the Adirondacks mattered almost as
little. His real home was at the office.</p>

<p>"In my New York office, and in every one of my
other offices round the world, there's a room like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
this. I alone use it. When I'm away, it stands for
me. It's my sign."</p>

<p>"Above there," he continued, pointing to the
central dome, "is the wireless apparatus which keeps
me in touch with my ships. From ship to ship and
office to office I can send my orders round the
world. I'm independent of the wires and the cables."</p>

<p>"That's epic!" she said, using the word she had
used before when he spoke to her of his early career.
No other word fitted Lars Larssen so closely.</p>

<p>"Heard from Clifford lately?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Only a brief cable from Winnipeg."</p>

<p>"I had a letter telling me things are going well,
but not as quickly as he expected. That letter
would be a week old by now. Every moment I'm
expecting to hear that his work is put through and
sealed up tight."</p>

<p>"I'm not anxious to have him back. If you only
could realize how he bores me to extinction."</p>

<p>She waited for an expression of sympathy.</p>

<p>"You've borne with it very bravely," he said,
knowing that to a woman like Olive no compliment
is dearer than to be called "brave."</p>

<p>"Not that I want to say a word against Clifford,"
he added quickly. "He's a very clever man of
business, and I admire him for it. But a woman
wants more than cleverness."</p>

<p>"How well you understand!" said Olive. "So
few know me as I really am. If only we had met
before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly as a door opened at the
farther end of the room. Morris Sylvester entered
briskly with a telegram in his hand. As confidential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
secretary, it was his duty to open all telegrams and
most of the letters addressed to his chief. Sylvester
passed the open telegram to Larssen, saying:</p>

<p>"Excuse my interruption. This telegram just
arrived seems important. I thought you would
like to see it."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Larssen glanced over it. "No answer
necessary."</p>

<p>Sylvester withdrew.</p>

<p>"It's a wire from your gay brother-in-law," said
Larssen to Olive.</p>

<p>"From John Rivi&egrave;re! Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In London. He proposes to call on me to-morrow
morning at eleven."</p>

<p>"I wonder what he has to say."</p>

<p>"I'm completely in the dark."</p>

<p>"I'd like to meet him."</p>

<p>"Shall I send him on to Roehampton after he's
seen me?"</p>

<p>Olive reflected that Rivi&egrave;re might not want to see
her, in view of the way he had avoided her so far.
She answered: "Ring me up on the 'phone when
he's in your office. I'll speak to him over the wire."</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;I'll remember.... By the way, about
the Hudson Bay company, did I tell you that the
underwriting negotiations are going through fine?
Inside a week we ought to be ready for flotation."</p>

<p>Larssen proceeded to enlarge on the subject, and
the broken thread of Olive's avowal was not taken
up again. They left the offices, and drove back to
the Cabaret to rejoin Sir Francis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">BEATEN TO EARTH</span></h2>


<p>At eleven o'clock the next morning, the shipowner
was at the horseshoe desk in his throne-room,
fingering the snapshot of Rivi&egrave;re which
Sylvester had secured at N&icirc;mes. He had seen in it
the picture of a man very like Clifford Matheson,
but not for a moment had he thought of it as the
portrait of the financier himself. The shaven lip,
the scar across the forehead, the differences of hair
and collar and tie and dress had combined to make
a thorough disguise.</p>

<p>Yet when the visitor entered by the farther door
of the throne-room and came striding resolutely
down the thirty yards of carpet, Lars Larssen knew
him. The carriage and walk were Matheson's.</p>

<p>For a moment hot rage possessed him. Not at
Matheson, but at himself. He ought to have guessed
before. This was the one possibility he had completely
overlooked. Matheson had tricked him by
shamming death. He ought not to have let himself
be tricked. That was inexcusable.</p>

<p>A moment later he had regained mastery of himself,
and a succession of plans flashed past his mental
vision, to be considered with lightning speed. The
financier held the whip-hand&mdash;and the whip must
be torn from him ... somehow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sit down, Matheson," said the shipowner calmly,
when his antagonist had reached the horseshoe
desk.</p>

<p>Neither man offered to shake hands.</p>

<p>Matheson took the seat indicated, and waited for
Larssen to begin.</p>

<p>Larssen knew the value of silence, however, and
Matheson was forced to open.</p>

<p>"You thought me dead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I knew you had disappeared for private reasons
of your own. I discovered those reasons, and so I
respected your privacy," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>"You had the cool intention of using my name in
the Hudson Bay prospectus as though I had given
you sanction for it."</p>

<p>"You did give me sanction."</p>

<p>"Written?"</p>

<p>"No; your word."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"At our last interview at your Paris office. You
passed your word&mdash;an Englishman's word&mdash;and I
took it."</p>

<p>Matheson ignored the cool lie. "Let's get down
to business," he said.</p>

<p>"With pleasure. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"When we last met," continued Matheson slowly,
"I wanted you to assign half of your four million
Deferred Shares to Lord &mdash;&mdash;, to be held in trust
for the general body of shareholders. Well, now&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;I
want the whole four million assigned."</p>

<p>"And you propose that I should give them up for
nothing?" queried Larssen ironically.</p>

<p>"For &pound;200,000 in ordinary shares. The monetary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
value is the same. The difference would be that
you'll have two hundred thousand with your own
money, not the British public's."</p>

<p>There was silence while the two men eyed one
another relentlessly. At the side of Larssen's forehead,
under the temple, a tiny vein throbbed and
jerked. That was the only outward sign of the
feelings of murder which lay in his heart.</p>

<p>"You have your nerve!" he commented.</p>

<p>"I'm offering you easy terms."</p>

<p>"Offer <i>me</i> terms!"</p>

<p>"Easy terms," repeated Matheson. "I could, if
I chose, step from here to my lawyers' and have you
indicted for conspiracy. I could get you seven to
ten years. I could have you breaking stones at
Portland."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you?"</p>

<p>"I have my private reasons."</p>

<p>"One of them being that you haven't a shred of
evidence," was the cool reply.</p>

<p>"Who sends cables in my name to my managers?"
demanded Matheson.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of that."</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> know it. One of your employees sends
them."</p>

<p>"Have you such a cable with you?"</p>

<p>Matheson ignored the retort. "You've told my
wife and my father-in-law that I was alive."</p>

<p>"I knew you <i>were</i> alive. Is that your idea of
fraud?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to quibble over words. Believing
me to be dead, you had me impersonated, planning
to use my name on the Hudson Bay scheme."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've not used your name."</p>

<p>"You used it to induce St Aubyn and Carleton-Wingate
to come on the Board."</p>

<p>"If you're thinking to prove that, you merely
waste your time. The negotiations were carried out
by your father-in-law."</p>

<p>"You used my name to a reporter on the <i>Europe
Chronicle</i>."</p>

<p>"Have you written evidence of that?"</p>

<p>"Martin will swear to it, if necessary."</p>

<p>Larssen laughed harshly. "An out-of-elbows
reporter on a sensational yellow journal! Do you
dream for one instant that his word would stand
against mine in a court of law? See here, Matheson,
you'd better go back and read over your brief with
the man who's instructing you. He's muddled up
the facts."</p>

<p>"Then what are the facts?" challenged
Matheson.</p>

<p>Lars Larssen took a deep breath before he leaned
forward across the horseshoe desk to answer. At
the same time he moved a hidden lever under the
desk. This was a device allowing any conversation
of his to be heard telephonically in the adjoining
room where his private secretary worked. It was
useful occasionally when he needed an unseen
listener to a business interview of his; and now he
particularly wanted Sylvester to hear what he and
Matheson were saying to one another. It would
give Sylvester his cue if he were to be called in at
any point.</p>

<p>"Matheson," said the shipowner, "the facts of
your case don't make a very edifying story. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
you're sure you want to hear them as you'd hear
them in a court of law, I'll spare another five minutes
to tell you. You're quite certain you'd like to hear
the outside view of your actions this past three
weeks?"</p>

<p>"I'm listening."</p>

<p>With brutal directness Larssen proceeded: "On
the night of March 14th, you decided you were tired
of your wife. Thought you'd like a change of bedfellow.
You left your coat and stick about a quarter-mile
down the left bank of the Seine from Neuilly
bridge, so that people would think you dead. You
cut a knife-slit in the ribs of your coat to make a
neater story of it. Then, as I guessed you would,
you went honeymooning with the other woman.
Away to the sunny South. I had you followed.</p>

<p>"You registered together at the Hotel du Forum
at Arles, taking the names of John Rivi&egrave;re and
Elaine Verney. A man doesn't change his name
unless he's got some shady reason for it. Every
court of law knows that. You dallied for a day or
two at Arles, getting this woman to write a lying
letter to your wife saying that you were down with
fever. We have that letter."</p>

<p>"We!"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>we</i>. We have that letter. I advised your
wife to let me keep it for possible emergencies. I
have it in this office along with the other evidence.
I don't bluff&mdash;shall I ring and have my secretary
show it to you?"</p>

<p>"Get on."</p>

<p>"Then you moved to N&icirc;mes, staying for shame's
sake at different houses. Hers was the Hotel de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Provence, and yours was the Villa Cl&eacute;mentine.
You went lovemaking with this woman in the
moonlight, up to a quiet place on the hillside, and
there you nearly got what was coming to you from
a peasant called Crau. Then you had this Verney
woman stay with you in your Villa Cl&eacute;mentine, and
finally you took her off to Wiesbaden."</p>

<p>Larssen ostentatiously pressed an electric bell.</p>

<p>"I'll give you chapter and verse," he said.</p>

<p>Morris Sylvester came in quietly from his room
close by, a slow smile under his heavy dark
moustache, and nodded greeting to Matheson. He
had heard by the telephone device all of his chief's
case against Matheson, and was quite ready to take
up his cue.</p>

<p>"Sylvester, you recognize this man?" said
Larssen.</p>

<p>"Yes. He is the Mr John Rivi&egrave;re I shadowed at
Arles and N&icirc;mes."</p>

<p>Larssen turned to the financier. "Want to
ask him any questions? Ask anything you
like."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite," answered Matheson. There was nothing
to be gained at this stage by cross-examining the
secretary.</p>

<p>"That will do, Sylvester."</p>

<p>The secretary left the room.</p>

<p>Larssen leant forward across the desk once more
and snarled: "There's the facts of the case as
they'll go before the divorce court."</p>

<p>"Do you know that Miss Verney is blind?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
There was a hoarseness in Matheson's voice; he
cleared his throat to relieve it.</p>

<p>"That's no defence in a divorce court."</p>

<p>"Blind and undergoing an operation this very
morning? Do you know that it's doubtful if she
will ever recover any of her sight?"</p>

<p>Larssen's mouth tightened a shade more. At
last he found the heel of Achilles. He could get at
Matheson through Elaine. Ruthlessly he answered:
"That's no concern of mine. I'm stating facts to
you. These facts are not all in your wife's possession.
Do you want me to put them there?"</p>

<p>"Your facts are a chain of lies. There's one
sound link: that I changed my name. The rest
are poisonous lies&mdash;provable lies."</p>

<p>"Whatever they may be, do you want them put
before your wife?" He reached for a swinging
telephone by his desk and called to the house
operator: "Get me P. O. Richmond, 2822. Name,
Mrs Matheson."</p>

<p>While he was waiting for the connection to be
made, Sylvester entered the room and silently showed
a visiting-card to his chief. It was Olive's card.
Acting on a sudden impulse, she had motored to
the office to see this mysterious John Rivi&egrave;re before
he should evade her. She knew that the interview
was to be at eleven o'clock, and by thus calling in
person, she would make certain of meeting him.</p>

<p>Larssen said aloud to his secretary: "Show her
up when I ring next."</p>

<p>Then to Matheson: "There's no need to 'phone.
Your wife is waiting below."</p>

<p>Sylvester left the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>As the shipowner's hand hovered over the button
of the electric bell, waiting for a yes or no from
his antagonist, a great temptation lay before
Matheson.</p>

<p>The recital of the events of the past three weeks,
as given in the brutal wording of the shipowner,
had torn at his nerves like the pincers of an inquisitor.
He saw now how the world would judge the relations
between Elaine and himself. The change of name,
the meeting at the same hotel at Arles, the second
meeting, the companionship of that fateful week at
N&icirc;mes&mdash;the world would put only one interpretation
on it all. Elaine, lying helpless in her close-curtained
room at the nursing home in Wiesbaden,
would be fouled with the imaginings of the prurient.
Not only had he brought blindness to her, but now
he was to bring her to the pillory with the scarlet
letter fixed upon her.</p>

<p>Yet he could avoid it if he chose. A choice lay
open to him. Larssen would be ready to exchange
silence for silence. If Matheson would stand aside
and let the Hudson Bay scheme go through, no
doubt Larssen would play fair in the matter of
Elaine. That in effect was what he offered as his
hand hovered over the electric bell.</p>

<p>The shipowner, though an easy smile of triumph
masked his feelings as he lay back in his chair, knew
that he was at the critical point of his career. If
Matheson decided to let Olive be shown in, then
Olive would have in her hands the judgment between
the two men. To be dependent on a woman's
mood, a woman's whim, would be Larssen's position.
It galled him to the quick. The seconds that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
slipped by while Matheson considered were minute-long
to him.</p>

<p>If only Matheson would weaken and propose
compromise!</p>

<p>Larssen uttered no word of persuasion one way
or another. He knew that, if his desire could be
attained, it would be attained through silence.</p>

<p>Presently Matheson stirred in his chair.</p>

<p>"Ring!" said he firmly.</p>

<p>The fight had begun again.</p>

<p>Larssen pressed the bell without a moment's
hesitation. His bluff had to be carried through
with absolute decisiveness. He could not gauge how
far his threat of the divorce court had intimidated
Matheson. Beyond that, he was not at all sure
that Olive would side with him in the matter.
She was unstable, unreliable.</p>

<p>But on the outside no trace of his doubts appeared.
He was perfectly cool, entirely master of
himself. As he waited for Sylvester to fetch Mrs
Matheson, he took out a pocket-knife and began to
trim his nails lightly.</p>

<p>Olive's appearance as she entered the throne-room
was greatly changed from that of the evening
before. The transient effect of the drug had worn
off. Her features were now heavy and listless, and
there were dark shadows under the eyes.</p>

<p>Both men rose to offer a seat.</p>

<p>"I came along to catch Mr Rivi&egrave;re before he
left you," she explained to Larssen, and turned with
a set smile towards the visitor.</p>

<p>For a moment or two she stared at Matheson in
amazement. Then:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it's Clifford! What have you been doing
to yourself? Why have you changed your appearance?
Why are you here? What's the meaning
of all this?"</p>

<p>"It's a long story," cut in Larssen, and "there
are two versions to it. Which will you hear first,
your husband's or mine?"</p>

<p>She hesitated to answer, her mind buzzing with
surprise, resentment, and anger. She hated to be
caught at a disadvantage, as in this case. She was
uncertain as to what her attitude ought to be.</p>

<p>Had Clifford, suspecting her feelings towards
Larssen, returned hurriedly in order to trap her?
What did he know? What did he guess?</p>

<p>Evidently she ought to be on her guard.</p>

<p>"Of course I will hear my husband first," she
answered coldly, and Larssen took it as an ill omen.
He offered her a chair again, and seated himself so
as to command them both.</p>

<p>Matheson, who remained standing, waved his
hand towards the shipowner. "Let him speak
first."</p>

<p>"I'm not anxious to," countered Larssen. "Fire
away with your own version."</p>

<p>"I hate all this mystery!" snapped Olive irritably.
"Mr Larssen, you tell me what it all means."</p>

<p>"Very well. <i>This</i> is Mr John Rivi&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"Rivi&egrave;re?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's your husband's <i>nom de discr&eacute;tion</i>."</p>

<p>"I thought it was Dean."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Rivi&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"Why is he back from Canada so soon?"</p>

<p>"He never went to Canada."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that the letter I received
from Arles was written by Clifford himself?"</p>

<p>"At his dictation."</p>

<p>"Who wrote it?"</p>

<p>Larssen turned to Matheson. "Do you wish me
to explain who wrote it, or will you do it yourself?"</p>

<p>"It was written at my dictation by a Miss Verney&mdash;a
lady whom I met for the first time on my visit
to Arles. Her relation to myself is that of a mere
tourist acquaintanceship."</p>

<p>"Why were you at Arles? Why was she at
Arles?"</p>

<p>"Miss Verney is&mdash;was&mdash;a professional scene-painter.
She was making a brief tour in Provence
to collect material for a Roman drama for which
she was commissioned to design the scenery."</p>

<p>"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"I want to know."</p>

<p>"About twenty-five, I should say."</p>

<p>"And what were you doing at Arles?"</p>

<p>Matheson found it very difficult to frame his
reasons under this remorseless cross-examination.
He felt as though he were in the witness-box at a
divorce trial, replying to hostile counsel.</p>

<p>"When I left Paris," he answered, "it was to
take a quiet holiday for a couple of months before
settling down to my new work."</p>

<p>"What new work?"</p>

<p>"I'll explain in detail later. Scientific research,
in brief."</p>

<p>Larssen scraped his chair scornfully. He would
not comment with words at the present juncture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Matheson was convicting himself out of his own
mouth&mdash;the revelation was unfolding excellently.</p>

<p>"You went to Arles for research?" pursued
Olive.</p>

<p>"No; for a holiday."</p>

<p>"A holiday from what&mdash;from whom?"</p>

<p>"From financial matters."</p>

<p>"Why did you take the name of John Rivi&egrave;re?"</p>

<p>"Because I intended to take that name permanently."</p>

<p>Olive was startled. "You meant to leave me!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I meant to disappear and give you your freedom
and the greater part of my property," answered
Matheson steadily.</p>

<p>"How freedom?"</p>

<p>"On the night of March 14th, the night I said
good-bye to you at the Gare de Lyon, I made a
sudden decision to take up my brother's work and
live his life. He has been dead a couple of years.
I happened to be attacked by a couple of <i>apaches</i>,
and that gave me the opportunity. I contrived
evidence of a violent death, and then cut loose
entirely from the name of Clifford Matheson. You
would be given leave by the courts to presume
death, on the evidence of my coat and stick left by
the river-bank at Neuilly. You would come into
my money and property, and you would be free to
marry again if you chose."</p>

<p>Olive had become very thoughtful. Her chin
was buried in her hand. When she spoke again
after a few moments' pause, it was in a strangely
altered tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you come back?" she said.</p>

<p>"Because Larssen was using my name in a way
I won't countenance. I was forced to return in
order to put a stop to it."</p>

<p>"Was that the only reason that made you
return?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it."</p>

<p>"You came back because Mr Larssen called you
back?"</p>

<p>"Because I found that he was having me impersonated,
and using my name illicitly."</p>

<p>Olive turned on the shipowner with a sudden wild
fury, her eyes shooting fire and her lips quivering.
"Why did you have Clifford impersonated?" she
hissed out.</p>

<p>Larssen was taken aback at this utterly unexpected
onslaught. "That's <i>his</i> version!" he
retorted.</p>

<p>"My husband says so&mdash;that's sufficient for me!"</p>

<p>"Then I can't argue."</p>

<p>"Do you deny it?"</p>

<p>"Emphatically!"</p>

<p>"You told me Clifford was in Canada, when all
the time you knew he was at Arles. Didn't you tell
me that?"</p>

<p>"To save his face."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Obviously because I knew he was dallying at
Arles and N&icirc;mes with this Verney woman. You
haven't heard one-tenth of the facts yet. You
haven't heard that he stayed in the same hotel
with her at Arles. Went with her to N&icirc;mes when
the hotel people began to object. At N&icirc;mes, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
decency's sake, they stayed at different houses, but
he had her hanging around his villa. Went lovemaking
with her in the moonlight up to a quiet
place on the hillside. Then, had her live with
him in the Villa Cl&eacute;mentine. Finally, took her
to Wiesbaden. These are all facts for which I
can bring you irrefutable evidence. I had my
secretary shadowing him from the moment he left
Paris."</p>

<p>Olive turned on her husband with another lightning
change of mood.</p>

<p>"Is she so very beautiful, this enchantress of
yours?" she queried with the velvety softness of
a cat.</p>

<p>"She is blind," answered Matheson with a quiver
in his words. "Blinded for life while trying to
warn me of a vitriol attack. Olive, I want you to
listen without interruption while I tell you on my
word of honour what are the facts underneath that
vile story of Larssen's. I want you to believe and
have pity.</p>

<p>"We had never seen one another before Arles.
There we met as casual tourists. It happened that
I was able to defend her from the assault of a
half-drunken peasant. After that we parted as
the merest acquaintances. By pure chance we met
again at N&icirc;mes. She came to N&icirc;mes to gather
further material for her scene-painting. For scene
purposes she had to make a sketch at night-time,
and I went with her as escort as I would have done
with any other woman. We were followed by the
peasant Crau. He was about to throw vitriol on
me when Miss Verney intervened. She received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the acid full in her eyes. She is, I believe, blinded
for life. Even now, as I speak, she lies on the
operating table.... Olive, there has been nothing
between us!"</p>

<p>His voice rang out in passionate sincerity.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," she replied icily.</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> believe it! I give you my word of
honour!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it! It's against human nature.
You're in love with her&mdash;that's plain. You had
opportunity enough. I know sufficient of human
nature to put two and two together. I shall certainly
sue for a divorce!"</p>

<p>"Against a blind girl?"</p>

<p>"I don't care a straw whether she's blinded or
not!"</p>

<p>And then, for the first time in all that long interview,
Matheson blazed into open anger.</p>

<p>"You know human nature?" he cried. "By
God, you know your own, and you measure every
other woman by yourself! Behind my back you
throw yourself at this damned scoundrel!" He
flung out his hand toward Larssen.</p>

<p>There was no answering anger in Larssen. He
knew too well the value of keeping cool. He merely
put in a word to egg Matheson on to a further
outburst.</p>

<p>"That's a chivalrous accusation to make,"
said he.</p>

<p>"It's true as everything else I've said! Last
night, at Thornton Chase, in the drawing-room
before dinner, I saw through, the uncurtained
window...."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Too late he pulled himself up short. The irrevocable
word had been said.</p>

<p>Olive was now implacable. Her voice was steely
as she answered:</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven you were dead!"</p>

<p>Larssen saw his supreme moment. "Why not?"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Let him disappear. Let him become John
Rivi&egrave;re for good and all."</p>

<p>"But my divorce?"</p>

<p>"Give it up&mdash;on conditions. You'll have your
freedom just the same."</p>

<p>"What conditions?"</p>

<p>"Ask your husband to sign approval of my
Hudson Bay prospectus as it stands."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he approve it?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Matheson. "That's why I
came back."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?"</p>

<p>"It gives Larssen control. It's greatly unfair to
the public."</p>

<p>"And just for that you came back? What a
reason!" Scorn lashed from her. "Yes, Mr
Larssen is right! I owe it to my self-respect to
be magnanimous. You can return to your mistress&mdash;I'll
forego my divorce. Sign the papers he
wants you to, and you can live out your life
as John Rivi&egrave;re. Your money, of course, comes
to me."</p>

<p>The shipowner, grimly triumphant, said nothing.
Matheson, in his blaze of anger, had turned Olive
definitely and finally against himself. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
no call for Larssen to add to the command of her
words.</p>

<p>Matheson's anger was spent. A great tiredness
crept over his will. He could fight no more.
Larssen and Olive had beaten him down&mdash;beaten
him down through his anxiety to shield Elaine.
Why should he sacrifice her for the sake of an
altruistic ideal? The public he had striven to protect
would not thank him for intervening in their
interests. He would be merely a quixotic fool.</p>

<p>He felt will-tired, soul-tired, more tired even than
on the night of March 14th. He could fight no
more.</p>

<p>He sank down into a chair, and presently he said
dully: "Show me the prospectus."</p>

<p>Larssen unhurriedly produced from a drawer in
his desk a private draft prospectus such as is offered
to the underwriters. On it was a list of names&mdash;the
firms to whom it was being shown confidentially
before public issue.</p>

<p>He reached for the electric bell to summon Sylvester
as a witness to Matheson's signature, but
at that very moment the secretary knocked and
entered quickly with an open cablegram, which he
passed to his chief.</p>

<p>Larssen's face grew white as he read it, but
he said nothing beyond: "Wait to witness a
signature."</p>

<p>Matheson took the prospectus and read it through
mechanically. The shipowner, with an appearance
of casualness, turned to a map on the wall behind
him and studied the position of his Atlantic liners
as indicated by the flag-pins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive remained seated, her eyes fixed remorselessly
on her husband.</p>

<p>Presently Matheson reached for a pen. "What
do you want on it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Simply 'O.K., Clifford Matheson,'" answered
the shipowner without turning round. "No date."</p>

<p>Matheson wrote across the printed document the
formal letters "O.K.," and signed below.</p>

<p>Sylvester witnessed the signature, and passed the
document to his chief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE BOLTED DOOR</span></h2>


<p>The moment he had that vital document
safe in his breast-pocket, Lars Larssen was
a changed man. His mask of cool indifference
and his assumption of perfect leisure were
thrown aside. His face was drawn with lines of
anxiety as he snapped a rapid stream of orders at
Sylvester:</p>

<p>"Send a wireless to the 'Aurelia' to put back
at once to Plymouth. 'Phone Paddington to have
a special ready for me in half-an-hour. 'Phone my
house to pack me a portmanteau and send it to
Paddington by fast car to catch the special. Get
my office car round at once. Tell Bates and Carew
and Grasemann I'd like them to travel with me to
Plymouth to talk business. Let me know when all
that's moving. Hurry!"</p>

<p>Sylvester sped away to execute his orders.</p>

<p>Larssen looked up at the portrait of his little
boy, and the cablegram fluttered to the ground.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Olive.</p>

<p>"Pneumonia. Dangerously ill."</p>

<p>"Poor little chap!"</p>

<p>"My only child!"</p>

<p>"He'll get over it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"He's never been strong and hardy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, with the best doctors...."</p>

<p>"If money can pull him through, I'll pour it out
like water. I'm off to the States to look after those
fool doctors. The 'Aurelia' is one of my fastest
boats, and she'll take me across in five days. I'll
give treble pay to every engineer and stoker."</p>

<p>"How long will you be away?"</p>

<p>"Can't say exactly."</p>

<p>"How unfortunate, just at this time!"</p>

<p>"I can finish off the Hudson Bay deal by wireless.
My ordinary business on this side will run on in the
hands of Bates, Carew, and Grasemann, who form
my executive committee for London."</p>

<p>They had both ignored Matheson through this
conversation. He was squeezed dry and done with.
Larssen had no further use for him at present, and
Olive had no sympathy to waste on a beaten man.</p>

<p>He had been sitting brokenly in a chair at the
desk where he had signed away his independence,
gazing into a new-spilt ink-blot on the polished
surface of the desk, seeing visions in its glistening,
blue-black pool.</p>

<p>But now he pushed back his chair with a rasping
noise and rose decisively to face Larssen.</p>

<p>"We'll call it a month's truce!" he flung out.</p>

<p>"What d'you mean?"</p>

<p>"For a month from now neither you nor I will
move further in the Hudson Bay scheme. For a
month it'll be hung up."</p>

<p>"Who's to hang it up?"</p>

<p>"I."</p>

<p>"But I've got your signed approval in my pocket.
Signed and witnessed!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"The issue is not yet underwritten." It was a
sheer guess, but in Larssen's face Matheson could
read that his guess was correct.</p>

<p>"Well?" snapped Larssen.</p>

<p>"Either you or I will tell the underwriters that
the scheme goes no further until a month from
date&mdash;until May 3rd. Which is it to be&mdash;you
or I?"</p>

<p>Sylvester came in rapidly. "All your orders are
being carried out, and the car's on the way here
from the garage."</p>

<p>For a few tense moments Larssen hesitated. The
underwriting of the five-million issue was an absolute
essential to a successful flotation, and the negotiations
were not yet completed. If Matheson were to
interfere in them during his absence from London,
big difficulties might develop. Before that cablegram
arrived, the shipowner could have beaten
down any such threat on Matheson's part, but now,
with his little son calling for his presence, with the
special train at Paddington coupling up to speed
him to Plymouth, with the "Aurelia" turning
back, against the protest of its thousand passengers,
to take him on board, the situation was radically
changed.</p>

<p>Matheson had realised the altered situation, and
putting aside any over-fine scruples, had gripped
advantage from it.</p>

<p>Larssen's eyes blazed anger at the financier. Then
he held out his hand to Olive.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" he said.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" she answered, taking his hand.</p>

<p>"You or I?" repeated Matheson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The shipowner turned at the door through which
he was hurrying out.</p>

<p>"I," he conceded.</p>

<p>"Then sign on it."</p>

<p>"Don't sign!" cried Olive.</p>

<p>"He <i>must</i> sign!"</p>

<p>Larssen rushed back to his desk and scribbled on
a sheet of paper: "Until May 3rd, I fix up nothing
with the underwriters."</p>

<p>He scrawled his signature under it, and without
further word hurried from the throne-room.</p>

<p>Matheson and his wife were left alone.</p>

<p>When Larssen had closed the door behind him,
Olive felt as if a big strong arm of support had
suddenly been taken away from her. Larssen's
mere presence, even if he remained silent, gave her
a fictitious sense of her own power, which now was
crumbling away and leaving her with a feeling of
insecurity and self-distrust.</p>

<p>Openly it expressed itself in peevish annoyance.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you have stayed away altogether?"
she muttered fretfully. "Nobody wanted
you back. Your scruples, indeed! I must say you
have a pretty mixed set of them. If you had had
any consideration for me, you'd have stayed away
altogether, instead of coming back and making
scenes of this kind. I hate scenes! And why did
you force that month's wait at the last moment?
Now things are complicated worse than ever!"</p>

<p>Matheson waited patiently for his wife to finish
the recital of her complaints. He wondered if it
were possible to appeal once more to her better
feelings. At all events he would make the attempt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
The signature he had forced out of Larssen had
given him back some of his self-respect, and he felt
his brain as it were cleared for action once more.</p>

<p>When Olive had finished, Matheson asked her
quietly: "Why did you marry me?"</p>

<p>"Why did you marry <i>me</i>?" she retorted.</p>

<p>"Because I honestly believed at the time that I
loved you."</p>

<p>"I suppose you found out afterwards that you'd
made a mistake, and then blamed it on to me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not blaming you&mdash;I'm trying to get the
right perspective on to our marriage. I'm wondering
if the woman I loved was yourself, or merely
my idealization of you."</p>

<p>"I can't help it if I'm not the incarnation of all
the virtues you imagined me to be!" Olive sat
down and played nervously with a penholder,
jabbing meaningless lines and dots on to a loose
sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"When I married you, I thought you were in
sympathy with me over the big things of life&mdash;the
things that matter. But you turned them aside
with a laugh. That put a barrier between us."</p>

<p>"I never could stand prigs. I thought I was
marrying a man of the world."</p>

<p>"We seemed to be radically opposed in ideas.
We drifted farther and farther away from one
another. At the end of five years, our marriage
was empty even of tepid affection. If there had
been children, perhaps...."</p>

<p>"No doubt you'd have wanted to wheel them
out in the perambulator!"</p>

<p>Matheson let the flippancy pass. He continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
steadily: "I felt I could not do my big work under
the constant friction of our married life, and my life
in the financial world. I felt you longed for complete
liberty."</p>

<p>"I did, and I do so still."</p>

<p>"So, when opportunity came to me on the night
of March 14th, I made the sudden decision you
know of. I thought I had cut myself loose. If it
had not been for that one unthought-of thread&mdash;Larssen's
scheme to use me dead or alive&mdash;I should
never have come back.... My sudden decision
was wrong. I realise now that no man can cut
himself utterly loose from the life he has woven for
himself. He is part of the pattern of the great web
of humanity. He is joined to the world around
him by a thousand threads. If he tries to cut loose,
there will always be some one unnoticed thread
linking him to the old life."</p>

<p>"That sort of thing may be interesting to people
who're interested in it. It merely bores me."</p>

<p>"Olive, I want to say this: I'm ready to try
once more. I'm ready to take up our married life
as we started it on our wedding day. I'll try to
forget the past and start afresh. I'll make allowances
for you&mdash;will <i>you</i> make allowances for me?"</p>

<p>Olive laughed mirthlessly. "In plain words,
that means you want me to be somebody I've never
pretended to be and never want to be. The idea
is fatuous."</p>

<p>"Won't you believe me when I say that I'm
genuinely anxious to do the right thing by you,
and clear up the tangle I've made of your life and
mine? I'm sorry for what I said in Larssen's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
presence a little while ago. I was angry and carried
beyond myself."</p>

<p>"No apology can wipe out that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best to make amends.... You're
not looking at all well. There's a big change in
you. Monte Carlo does you no good&mdash;the reverse
in fact. Why not see a doctor and get him to prescribe
you a tonic and a quiet place to build up
your health in? We'll go there together and start
our married life afresh."</p>

<p>"You've had your say&mdash;now let me have mine!"
flung out Olive. "When we married, I was mistaken
too. I thought at the time you were a man who
could do things. I judged on your previous career.
After we were married, I found I was utterly misled.
It isn't in you to climb to the top. You've too many
sides to your nature. First one thing pulls you one
way, and then another thing pulls you another way.
To succeed, a man has to run in blinkers&mdash;straight
on without minding the side issues. I imagined you
a hundred per center, and I found you only a ninety
per center. You can't climb to the top&mdash;it isn't in
you!"</p>

<p>"Climb to where?"</p>

<p>Olive looked around at the vast throne-room of
the shipowner, and her meaning was conveyed in
the glance.</p>

<p>"Larssen has that final ten per cent.," admitted
Matheson. "But do you know what it means in
plain language?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Utter unscrupulousness. Utter ruthlessness.
Napoleon had that extra ten per cent. Bismarck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
had it. You're right when you say I haven't
it."</p>

<p>Olive moved irritably in her chair. "Sour
grapes," she commented.</p>

<p>"Call it that if you wish."</p>

<p>She dug her pen viciously into the polished
surface of the desk, leaving the holder quivering at
the outrage.</p>

<p>"Larssen has been merely playing with you,"
continued Matheson. "I don't want to blame, but
to warn. I know the man far better than you do.
He thinks you might be useful to him."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do when the month is
up?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>She looked him straight in the eye, her pupils
narrowed with hate. "Go out of my life!"</p>

<p>"A legal separation?"</p>

<p>"No use at all. That ties me indefinitely."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"One of two things: divorce or disappearance."</p>

<p>"You mean a framed-up divorce? The usual
arranged affair?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I mean a divorce with that
Verney woman as co-respondent."</p>

<p>"I'll not have you insult her by calling her 'that
Verney woman!'"</p>

<p>"Miss Verney, then.... It's either divorce or
total disappearance."</p>

<p>"Larssen spoke glibly enough of disappearance,
but the circumstances are very different now from
what they were on the night of March 14th. Then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
not a soul outside myself knew of my intention.
You'd have claimed leave from the Courts to presume
death, and it would certainly have been
granted you. You would legally have been a widow,
and I&mdash;as Clifford Matheson&mdash;should legally have
been dead.... But now, both you and Larssen,
and his secretary as well, know that Clifford Matheson
is alive."</p>

<p>"Does anyone else know?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Larssen will certainly keep the secret. So will
his secretary. So shall I. That's no difficulty."</p>

<p>"You mean to apply to the courts for a certificate
of my death, knowing that it will be
fraudulent."</p>

<p>"That, or divorce against you and Miss Verney."
The lines of obstinacy were hard-set around her
mouth.</p>

<p>"Why are you so bitter against her?"</p>

<p>Olive remained contemptuously silent. Her
reason, as she saw it, should be obvious enough.
If Clifford was so dense as not to see it, she was
certainly not going to enlighten him.</p>

<p>Even in face of what had gone before, Matheson
was still hoping to soften his wife towards Elaine.
He tried again. "Her life is ruined. Her work
was her happiness as well as her livelihood. Now,
both are snatched away from her. She is an
orphan; she has no relatives in sympathy with her;
her means are very limited; she has heavy expenses
to face over the operation and the convalescence.
She is under Hegelmann's care at Wiesbaden. This
very morning he is operating on her. I must go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
back to Wiesbaden at once to hear how things are
going."</p>

<p>"You can wire and find out."</p>

<p>"I prefer to go personally."</p>

<p>"Is she so very attractive to you?"</p>

<p>Matheson, sick at heart, reached for his hat and
stick preparatory to taking his leave.</p>

<p>A sudden thought struck Olive. "You swear to
me that you've told no one you're Clifford
Matheson?"</p>

<p>"No one knows beyond yourself, Larssen, and
Sylvester."</p>

<p>"And you'll tell no one else?"</p>

<p>"I must reserve that right."</p>

<p>"It's not in our bargain!" protested Olive.
"You were to disappear completely."</p>

<p>"It won't affect our bargain," he retorted.</p>

<p>"That's for me to say."</p>

<p>"Heaven knows that I've given up to you enough
already!"</p>

<p>"I ask you to swear to me you'll never tell anyone
else! Not even hint at it!"</p>

<p>"I can't promise it."</p>

<p>"That's your last word?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Olive flashed hate at him. Her hands were
quivering when she answered, as though she could
have torn him in pieces.</p>

<p>"Very well, then! I'll reserve my right of
action too!" Her fingers reached for the electric
bell and pressed it imperatively.</p>

<p>When Sylvester appeared, she said decisively:
"Have a cab called for Mr Rivi&egrave;re."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," he answered.</p>

<p>The financier took up hat and stick, and with a
cold "good-bye" passed out of the open door,
Sylvester following him.</p>

<p>Presently the secretary returned to confer with
Olive. Larssen had told him to keep in touch with
her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Clifford Matheson was once more John Rivi&egrave;re.
He picked up his valise at the Avon Hotel and
caught the first boat train for Germany. It took
him to the Continent via Queenboro'&mdash;Flushing.</p>

<p>His thoughts on the railway journey to Queenboro'
were very different to those which had filled
his mind when he sped Calaiswards on his way to
England. Then, he had felt as if he had just plunged
into an ice-cold lake, and emerged tingling in every
limb with the vigour of health renewed. The course
before him had seemed straight; the issue clean-cut.</p>

<p>Now, he felt as if he had been tripped up and
pushed bodily into a pool of mire.</p>

<p>Circumstances seemed more tangled than ever.
Finality had not been reached either in regard to
his relations towards his wife, towards Elaine, or
towards Larssen; in regard to the Hudson Bay
scheme, or in his regard to his future freedom for
work on the lines he so earnestly desired. The
whirlpool had sucked him back, and he was once
more battling with swirling waters.</p>

<p>Out of all the welter of his thoughts one course
became clearer and clearer. He must tell Elaine.
He must put her in possession of the main facts of
the situation which had developed in Larssen's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
office. That he could tell her without violating the
spirit of his bargain with Olive was certain. He
knew he could trust absolutely in Elaine's silence.</p>

<p>Till then&mdash;till he had told her&mdash;there was no
definite line of action he could see as the one inevitable
solution.</p>

<p>If the elements had seemed to bar his passage to
London the day before, to-day they seemed to be
calling welcome to him as train and boat sped him
eastwards. The marshes of the Swale were almost
a joyous emerald green under the sparkle of the sun
in the early afternoon; the estuary of the Thames
was alive with white and brown sail swelling full-bloodedly
to the drive of a care-free, joyful breeze;
torpedo-boats and destroyers sped in and out from
Sheerness with the supple strength of greyhounds
unleashed, tossing the blue waters in curling locks
of foam from their bows; the open sea sparkled
and glinted and danced with the joy of life in its
veins.</p>

<p>At sundown, the sky behind the foaming wake
of the packet was a blaze of glory. The sinking sun
wove a cloth of gold on the halo of cloud about it,
and circled the horizon with a belt of rose and opal.
Gradually the gold faded into fiery purple, with
arms of unbelievable green stretching out to clasp
the round cup of ocean; the purple died away
reluctantly like the drums of a triumphant march
receding to a distance; night took sea and sky into
her arms, and crooned to them a mother-song of
rest.</p>

<p>On the railway station at Flushing a telegram was
handed to Rivi&egrave;re&mdash;the reply to a telegram of inquiry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
sent by him from London. It was from Elaine
herself:</p>

<p>"Operation well over. Doctor hopeful. Little
pain. Glad when you are back," it ran, and he had
almost worn through its creases, by reason of folding
and unfolding, before he fell asleep that night in the
train for Wiesbaden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE CHAMELEON MIND</span></h2>


<p>Many men are chameleons. They take
their mental colour from the surroundings
of the moment. They are swayed by
every fresh change of circumstance, influenced by
every strong mind with whom they come in contact.
If such a man goes on from year to year in the
same even groove of work, the chameleon mind
may not be apparent on the surface; but if by any
chance he is suddenly jolted from his accustomed
groove, the mental instability becomes plain to
read.</p>

<p>Arthur Dean was of this class.</p>

<p>When a clerk at &pound;2 per week he had looked
forward to promotion to &pound;3 a week as something
dazzling in its opulence, while &pound;4 a week represented
the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow.
Now a sudden turn of Fortune's wheel had lifted
him to a salary of &pound;6 a week and all expenses paid,
and the work he was required to do for his money
was so trifling in amount as to be almost ludicrous.
He had merely to read over a few letters and
send off a few brief cablegrams saying nothing in
particular.</p>

<p>As Lars Larssen had tersely phrased it, he was
no longer a "clerk"&mdash;he was a "business man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>And he knew that if he carried out orders faithfully
and intelligently, his future with his employer
was assured. Larssen had a strong reputation for
loyalty to his employees. He exacted much, but
he gave much in return. As his own fortunes
grew, so did those of his right-hand men. If a
man after faithful service was stricken down by
illness, Larssen allowed him a liberal pension.</p>

<p>That was "business" as the shipowner viewed
it in his broad, far-sighted way. He saw business
not as the mere handling of goods, but as the handling
of <i>men</i>. In the attainment of his ambitions
he was dependent on faithful service from his
employees, and accordingly he made it worth their
while to be faithful. He was liberal to them because
liberality paid him. His position in the world
was somewhat like that of a robber baron in the
Middle Ages, carving out a kingdom with the help
of loyal followers. The people he plundered were
the outsiders, and a certain share of the spoils went
to his men.</p>

<p>So Dean knew that if he carried out thoroughly
the work entrusted to him, Larssen would stand
by his spoken promise. He resolved to obey
orders as faithfully and as intelligently as he possibly
could. He did not write home what form his new
work was taking. In his letters to Daisy he explained
simply that he was being sent to Canada
on a confidential mission, at a big increase of salary,
and that he was having a regal time of it. At
Quebec and Montreal and Ottawa and Winnipeg
he scoured the shops to find presents which would
carry to her a realisation of his new position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Dean began to feel his importance growing
rapidly as he journeyed across the Atlantic and
around the principal cities of Canada. He thought
he realised the meaning of "business" as it was
viewed by the men up above, the men at the roll-top
desks. He saw now that it was not hard, plugging
work that earned them their big salaries. In a
short fortnight he had begun to look a little contemptuously
on the grinders and plodders. Why
couldn't they realise how little their patient, plodding
service could ever bring them? But some men,
he reflected, were born to be merely clerks all their
days. He was different&mdash;out of the common ruck.
He could see largely, like Lars Larssen did. He
was a man of importance.</p>

<p>Canada pressed a broad thumb on his plastic
mind without his conscious knowledge. Canada
with her young, red-blooded vigour swept into him
like a tidal wave of open sea into a sluggish, marshy
creek. Canada thrust her vastness and her limitless
potentialities at him with a careless hand, as
though to say: "Here's opportunity for the
taking." Canada taught him in ten days what at
home he would never have learnt in a lifetime:
that London is not the British Empire.</p>

<p>The clerk who lives out his life in the rabbit-warren
of the city of London by day, and in a
cheap, pretentious, red-brick suburb by night,
believes firmly that outside London not much
matters. He lumps together the Canadian, the
South African, the Australian, and the New Zealander
under the slighting category of "colonials." He
imagines them bowing themselves humbly before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the majesty of the Londoner, taking their cues
from London and reverencing it as the fount of all
wisdom and might and wealth.</p>

<p>There is no one more "provincial" than the
Cockney born and bred.</p>

<p>After ten days of Canada, Dean with his chameleon
mind felt himself almost a Canadian. He was
beginning to pity the limitations of the Londoner.
He considered himself raised above that level.</p>

<p>Winnipeg, the new "wheat pit" of North America,
impressed him most strongly. He could feel the
bursting strength of the young city&mdash;a David
amongst cities. He could feel it growing under
his feet to its kingdom of the granary of Britain.
The epic of the wheat pulsed its stately poetry into
him&mdash;thrilled him with the majestic chords of its
mighty song.</p>

<p>He had a half-idea that Lars Larssen's big scheme
was in some way connected with the epic of the
wheat, and it gave him fresh importance to think
that he was serving such a man in so confidential
a position.</p>

<p>He tried a little gamble in "May wheat" with
a Winnipeg bucket-shop, plunging what was to
him the important sum of twenty dollars. Luck
was with him full-tide. From the moment he
bought, May wheat shot upwards, and in a few
days he had closed the deal with fifty dollars to his
credit.</p>

<p>That evening he wandered around the city with
money jingling in his trouser-pockets. He bought
himself a good seat at a music-hall, and at the bar
boldly ordered cocktails with weird names of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
which the contents were wonderful mysteries to
him.</p>

<p>On his way home to his hotel about midnight, a
flaming placard outside a tin-roofed chapel caught
his eye and stopped him for a moment. The
wording was crudely sensational:</p>

<p class='center'>
THE WICKED FLOURISH!<br />
BUT FOR HOW LONG?<br />
A LIFETIME OF EASE FOR AN ETERNITY OF HELL-FIRE!<br />
DO YOU CHOOSE HELL?<br />
MAKE YOUR CHOICE TO-NIGHT!<br />
</p>

<p>The meeting inside the chapel was in full swing.
A roar of voices raised in a marching hymn swept
out to the deserted street. Dean's lips curved
contemptuously for a moment. Then the whim
came to him to finish his night's amusement by a
sarcastic enjoyment of the revivalist service. He
would go inside and watch other people making
fools of themselves.</p>

<p>He entered the swinging doors of the chapel into
a room hot with the odour of packed humanity,
and found a place for himself at the rear.</p>

<p>Presently the hymn ended on a shout of triumph
and a deep, solemn "Amen." There was a shuffling
and scraping of feet as the congregation sat down
and prepared itself to listen to the preacher.</p>

<p>He was a tall, lean man of fifty-five, with a thin
grey beard and a hawk nose, and eyes that burnt
with the intensity of inner fire. He was the ascetic,
the fanatic, the man with a burning message to
deliver. His eyes sought round his congregation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
before he gave out his text, seeking for the souls
that might be ready for the saving.</p>

<p>"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and
was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom;
the rich man also died, and was buried. And in
hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And
he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on
me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of
his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am
tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son,
remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy
good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but
now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."</p>

<p>The preacher read out the words with a slow,
even intensity, making them carry the weight of
the inevitable. He paused for them to sink
in before he began the delivery of his own
message.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said, "listen to this story from
life. Many years ago there was a young man in
this very city who had a great temptation placed
before him. He was a clerk in an office, as many
of you are. He was ambitious, as many of you
are. He was hoping for riches and power, as many
of you are.</p>

<p>"One day the devil tempted him. He could
become rich if he chose to sacrifice his conscience.
The devil promised him riches and power and all
that his heart could desire. And he fell.</p>

<p>"My friends, the devil kept his literal promise.
He always does. When he comes to you in the
watches of the night, and offers you all that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
desire on earth in return for your soul, you can
know that he will keep his promise.</p>

<p>"The young man is now rich and famous, and
if I told you his name, you would say that he is a
man to be envied. You see his portraits in the
papers; you hear of his mansions and his motor-cars,
his yachts and his splendid entertainments;
and you would never dream that he is the most
unhappy man in Canada.</p>

<p>"The devil has given him everything he lusted
for. And yet, not ten days ago, he came to me in
secret and begged for help and counsel. His riches
and power have turned to wormwood in his mouth.
His wife and children hate him. His friends are
only friends because he has money. He is the most
lonely, the most miserable of men."</p>

<p>The preacher leant forward over the pulpit and
half whispered: "The wicked flourish like the
green bay tree, but who knows what secret canker
eats into their hearts? The devil stands beside
them and whispers mockingly: 'I have given you
everything your heart lusted for; does it taste sweet?
Does it taste sweet?' So much for this world;
and now, my friends, what of the next world?"</p>

<p>The preacher straightened himself and with
passionate sincerity flung out a torrent of warning
and exhortation to his congregation&mdash;a lava-stream
of burning words that bit into their very souls.
Dean, who had come to mock, listened with a
clutch at his heart that made him first shiver and
then turn burning hot and faint. He passed his
handkerchief over his forehead nervously, gripped
at the seat to steady himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>At length he could stand the strain no longer
As he rose and stumbled his way towards the door,
towards the fresh air, the preacher stopped in his
discourse to send an individual message to him.</p>

<p>"Stay, my friend!" he cried. "To-night is
the hour for you to choose. To-morrow I shall be
gone. To-morrow will be too late. Choose now!"</p>

<p>But Dean had thrust open the swinging doors and
had disappeared into the night.</p>

<p>At his hotel the porter handed him a telegram
just arrived. It was from Lars Larssen&mdash;an order
to proceed to New York and wait the shipowner's
arrival there. It had been despatched by wireless
from on board the s.s. "Aurelia."</p>

<p>That scrap of paper came as a bracing tonic to
Arthur Dean. It was an order, and just now he
ached to be ordered. The curt message out-weighed
all the burning words of the preacher. Even
from three thousand miles away Lars Larssen could
grip hold of the mind of the young fellow and
bend it to his purpose.</p>

<p>The next morning Dean was smiling scornfully at
his weakness of the night before. He paid for a
train ticket for New York via Toronto in a newly
confident frame of mind. He was Larssen's man
again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the beginning of the journey Dean read papers
and magazines and smoked away the long hours.
Tiring of that eventually, he sauntered to the
observation platform at the rear of the train.</p>

<p>And there he found the preacher.</p>

<p>There was an embarrassing silence. The minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
knew him at once for the young man who had left
his chapel the night before in the middle of the
discourse. Dean knew that he was recognized,
but did not wish to appear cognizant of it. He
tried to look indifferent, but with poor success.</p>

<p>The minister broke the silence by offering his
card and saying: "One day you may need my
help. If it please the Lord that I am alive then,
come to me and I will help you."</p>

<p>Dean took the card and read the name, the Rev.
Enoch Stephen Way, and a Toronto address. He
pocketed the card and murmured a conventional
thanks.</p>

<p>"You are an Englishman?" said the minister.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Travelling on business?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The answer was curt, and the minister saw that
the young man resented any cross-examination
of his private affairs. He therefore turned the
conversation at once to impersonal matters.</p>

<p>"How do you like Canada? How does it strike
you?"</p>

<p>"Fine!" answered Dean, relieved at the turn of
the conversation. "So big."</p>

<p>"You mean the extent of the country?"</p>

<p>"It's not that, quite. I mean that people seem
to think in a bigger way. I suppose it comes from
having so much space around one."</p>

<p>The train was now passing through the endless
miles of forest-land and tangled hills on the route
to Fort William, with scarcely a sign of human
habitation except by the occasional wayside stations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Now and again the train would thunder over a high
trestle bridge above a leaping torrent-river. Dean
waved his hand vaguely to include the primeval
vastnesses around them.</p>

<p>"That's right," answered the minister. "There's
no cramping here. Room for everyone. Room
for spiritual growth as well as material growth. I
know the feeling you have. When I was a young
man about your age I came to Canada from the
slums of Liverpool. I had been twice in jail in
Liverpool. It was for theft. In England I should
probably have developed into a chronic thief.
There's little chance for a man who has once been
in prison.... But Canada gave me my chance.
Canada didn't bother about my past. Canada
only wanted to know what I could do in the
future."</p>

<p>Dean's eyes widened at this frank avowal. He
had never seen or heard of a man&mdash;and especially
a man in the ministry&mdash;who would openly confess
to a prison-brand upon him.</p>

<p>"No wonder you like Canada," was his lame
answer.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my friend, why you left my chapel so
hurriedly last night."</p>

<p>Dean flushed. "I was feeling a bit faint," he
returned.</p>

<p>"That's conscience."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. The chapel was very packed
and hot."</p>

<p>"It was conscience. Why won't you be frank
with me?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be frank about."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>The minister looked steadily at him, and Dean
flushed still further and fidgetted uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I must be getting back to my carriage," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"The Lord has brought you to me a second
time. There may never be a third time. The
Lord has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden jerk of the car threw them both off
their feet. They were passing now over a high
trestle bridge above a foaming torrent. There
was a horrible grinding and jarring and crashing.
The tail-car of the train flicked out sideways and
hung half over the river, dragging with it the cars
in front. For an age-long second it seemed as if
the whole train would be precipitated into the
water.</p>

<p>Then the couplings parted.</p>

<p>The end car, turning over and over, struck the
river a hundred feet below and impaled itself on a
jagged spur of rock hidden under the swirl of
waters.</p>

<p>Dean had been battered to insensibility before
the car reached the rocks.</p>

<p>He awoke to consciousness through the agonized
dream that fiends were staking him down under
water and torturing him by letting the water rise
higher and higher, until finally he would be drowned
by inches.</p>

<p>He awoke, struggling frantically, to the reality
which had dictated the dream.</p>

<p>Waters were swirling around him, and his legs
were pinned fast in the wreckage of the car tilted
up on end amongst the sunken rocks. Burning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
pains shot through him. Far up above on the
bridge men were shouting and rushing wildly.</p>

<p>He screamed out for help. A wave dashed at
him and choked the scream on his lips. He struggled
to free himself from the wreckage that pinned him
fast, and blinding pain drove him to unconsciousness
again.</p>

<p>As he awoke for the second time, a groan near by
made him twist his head to see who it might come
from. It was the minister, held fast amongst the
splintered wreckage of the car, his face streaming
red from a jagged gash in his grey head.</p>

<p>"I can't get to you! I'm helpless!" cried Dean.</p>

<p>The minister answered very simply: "My friend,
see to yourself. The Lord has called me to his side."</p>

<p>With a sudden jerk the car settled deeper in the
torrent. Only by straining to the uttermost could
Dean keep his mouth to the air above the swirl of
waters.</p>

<p>"Help!" he screamed to the bridge above.
"I'll be drowned! Help!"</p>

<p>The minister began to pray aloud: "Lord, Thou
hast been pleased to call me, and I come. Receive
my soul in pity, and forgive me my many sins.
And, oh Lord God, grant that this my young friend
may live to see the light and to worship Thee. Let
this be his hour of repentance. Start him upon a
new path, and keep his feet from straying. In thy
mercy save him that he might live to Thy glory.
Show him what Thou hast shown me, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The minister's hand dropped suddenly forward,
and the waters closed over him with a snarl.</p>

<p>From the bridge far above a man was being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
lowered on a rope, like a spider hanging from a
thread.</p>

<p>Dean watched him with paralyzed tongue. The
strain to keep his head above the waters was racking
him like a torment of the Inquisition. The horror
of the situation grew with every second. Why
did they lower so slowly? Would release ever come
in time to save him?</p>

<p>His hour of repentance! Yes, the preacher was
right. This was his punishment for the part he
had taken in the fraudulent personation of Clifford
Matheson. It came to Dean like a blinding flash
of light that God was demanding of him whether
he would repent or no&mdash;whether he would vow
to run straight for the future.</p>

<p>The man on the rope was growing larger. His
face held the solemnity of an Eternal Judge. In
his two hands were scrolls marked Riches and
Poverty. He held them out towards Dean, demanding
his instant choice. The young man
begged for a moment to consider. He shut his
eyes against the decision thrust upon him. A
voice thundered in his ears....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">LARSSEN'S MAN ONCE AGAIN</span></h2>


<p>Of the eleven passengers in the car that
plunged over the bridge, Arthur Dean
was the only one saved. Nine had been
drowned in the interior of the car when it crashed
amongst the rocks of the torrent. Only Dean and
the minister, standing in the observation platform
at the rear of the car, had had a chance of life, and
the minister had died before help had reached him.
The shock affected Dean more seriously than his
injuries, which were nothing worse than severe
bruises and cuts. He knew that he had had a
miraculous escape, and the horror of the peril wove
in and out of his thoughts as he lay in hospital at
Fort William, haunting dreams and waking thoughts
alike.</p>

<p>When he left the hospital he was a changed man&mdash;white
and gaunt of face, and resolved in purpose
to tell Lars Larssen at once that he would serve
him no longer.</p>

<p>He made for New York, and went straight to
the shipowner's offices. These were situated at
the very beginning of Broadway, overlooking
Battery Park, on the tip of the tongue of Manhattan
Island. Inside, they were very much on the same
lines of the London offices&mdash;in fact, the latter were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
modelled on them. Above the dome of the building
stretched the antenn&aelig; of Larssen's wireless.</p>

<p>To his intense disappointment, Dean was informed
that the chief was away from New York, by the
bedside of his little son at his school in Florida.</p>

<p>The young fellow had worked himself up to the
point of handing in his resignation; he had fixed
on just what he would say to his employer; and
this check threw him back on his haunches. To
travel down to Florida would cost money, and he
did not feel justified in paying for the journey out
of the expenses allowance given him by Larssen.
To explain by letter was too difficult. After some
thought he decided to take a return ticket by day
coach, and to pay for it out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>Golden Beach, where the school was situated,
was a fashionable winter resort on the Florida
coast. In one of its several palatial hotels, Larssen
had engaged a suite of rooms and had made himself
a temporary office. Dean carried his modest
portmanteau to the hotel, and waited in the piazza
until Larssen should return from a visit to his boy.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the shipowner
came striding along the white, palm-shaded road,
purpose and masterfulness in every movement.
When he caught sight of Dean waiting on the
piazza, he came up with a hand outstretched in
cordial greeting.</p>

<p>"Well, Dean, how are you feeling now? The
accident must have given you a terrific shake-up."</p>

<p>"Much better, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"Looks to me you could do with a fortnight's
complete holiday," said Larssen, surveying critically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the gaunt white face of the young man. "Say so,
and it's yours."</p>

<p>Dean stammered some words of thanks. This
cordial greeting threw him into confusion&mdash;made
it so much more difficult to say what he had come
to say. For a moment's respite, he asked after
Larssen's little boy.</p>

<p>"He'll pull round. The crisis is over. His
constitution's weak, but he'll pull round. Money
saved him. On the 'Aurelia' I got hold of all
the facts of the case by wireless, and took a grip
of the situation. I sized up the doctors here as a
couple of well-meaning fools. I wired to Chicago
for a man who's made a speciality of opsonic treatment
for pneumonia. His own invention&mdash;something
the other doctors sneer at. I had him packed
from Chicago to Golden Beach by special train,
with full authority to boss the case.... Yes,
it's money that saved my boy. Money, Dean,
holds the power of life and death. Money is the
mightiest thing in this world. I expect you've
come to realise that lately, now you've left off being
a clerk."</p>

<p>Dean gulped and answered: "That's what I've
come to speak to you about, sir."</p>

<p>The shipowner shot a swift glance at him. "Come
to my office," he said, and led the way.</p>

<p>When he had the young fellow seated with the
light full on him, Larssen asked coldly: "What's
your song? Looking for a raise already?"</p>

<p>"No, it's not that. I don't feel I can carry
out this work."</p>

<p>"What work?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your work."</p>

<p>"Talk it longer."</p>

<p>"It's like this, sir. When I was in Winnipeg, I
went one night to a music-hall, and on my way
home I went by chance into a chapel meeting."</p>

<p>"Music-hall or chapel&mdash;it's all one to me, so
long as you're not a drinker. You're free to spend
your evenings as you like, provided it doesn't
interfere with your work."</p>

<p>"There was a preacher there, a Mr Enoch Way,
who impressed me very strongly, sir. So much so
that I had to leave the meeting. When I got
back to my hotel, I found a wire from you telling
me to travel to New York. I caught the morning
train, and on the train I met Mr Way again. We
were on the observation platform together when
the railway-car went over the bridge. He died
not a yard away from me, down in the river! He
was a fine man&mdash;a great man! and if I could die
like he died, with a prayer on his lips for someone
who was only a stranger&mdash;&mdash;" Dean choked and
stopped.</p>

<p>Presently he resumed: "And when I lay in
hospital at Fort William, I thought things over
and over. I began to see clearly that I ought
never to have taken on the work you asked me
to do."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It's not right, sir! You know what you
asked me to do wasn't right! It's fraud!" The
words came clear and strong now.</p>

<p>If Larssen had been a man of ordinary passions,
he would have kicked Dean out of the door and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
told him to go to the devil. But the shipowner
had not reached his present power by giving way to
ordinary feelings.</p>

<p>He answered very quietly: "I should have
liked to meet that Mr Way. He must have been a
man of personality. What did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I didn't tell him anything. I think he guessed.
He was that kind of man&mdash;he could read right into
you."</p>

<p>"What did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"The story of his life. He had been in prison
twice when he was a young man."</p>

<p>"I mean, what did he tell you to do?"</p>

<p>"He told me it was my hour for repentance.
That was when we were in the observation platform
together. The next moment we were thrown over
the bridge."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"He died praying God to help me to repent and
live straight!"</p>

<p>"Repent of what?"</p>

<p>"Of taking part in a fraud. Of pretending a
dead man was still alive&mdash;going to Canada and
sending letters in his name so that his friends would
think he was still alive. I don't know how I could
have brought myself to do such a thing! I was
tempted, I suppose, and I fell. But temptation
is nothing&mdash;it's falling to temptation that matters!
That's what he said in his sermon."</p>

<p>"Anything else to repent of?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very much, sir. Of course I've not
been all I should have been, but I'd never done
anything radically wrong until then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The shipowner rose and laid a hand on the young
man's shoulder. "I appreciate your feelings,"
he said. "They do you credit, Dean. You're
sound and straight, and that's what I want in my
young men."</p>

<p>Dean looked up in surprise. "I don't think
you quite understand, sir. I've come here to-day&mdash;come
at my own expense&mdash;to hand you in my
resignation."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no need for it. You've been
worrying yourself over a bogey."</p>

<p>"A bogey!"</p>

<p>"Yes. There's been no 'fraud' at all. Clifford
Matheson is as alive as you are. He knows perfectly
well that you've been in Canada for
him."</p>

<p>"But the overcoat and stick! They were his&mdash;I'll
swear to it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they were his right enough. He laid
them by the river-bank at Neuilly himself."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"That's complicated to answer. I don't know
that I ought to tell you without Mr Matheson's
express permission. In fact, I want you to keep
what I've just told you entirely to yourself."</p>

<p>Dean felt bewildered. There was suspicion in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Larssen saw the suspicion and continued rapidly.
"You think I'm trying to bluff you? I never
bluff with my staff, whatever I may do outside.
I'll give you proof. Have you got those signatures
of Clifford Matheson's?"</p>

<p>Dean produced them from his pocket-book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>The shipowner rapidly unlocked his desk and
drew out a printed document which he placed in
the young man's hands.</p>

<p>"Now see here. This prospectus was printed
off a week after you left for Canada. You can
know that by the printed date. Now what is the
wording written over it in ink?"</p>

<p>"'O.K., Clifford Matheson,'" read out Dean.</p>

<p>"Compare it with your two signatures."</p>

<p>"It's the same."</p>

<p>"Exactly. That prospectus was passed by Mr
Matheson some time after you imagined him dead
and buried."</p>

<p>Dean could answer nothing. The world had
turned upside down for him. Larssen took the
prospectus and the two specimen signatures, and
locked them away in his desk.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked smilingly. "Am I the
devil tempting you to run crooked?"</p>

<p>"I must apologize, sir&mdash;apologize sincerely!
I didn't know of all this. I thought&mdash;&mdash;I
thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all over now. We'll forget it. You've
proved to me you're sound and straight. You've
carried out orders well. Carry out future orders
in the same way, and I'll do everything I've promised
for you. You know that I never break a promise
to my staff?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir. That's well known."</p>

<p>"Well, my next order is this: take a fortnight's
holiday and get strong again.... Do you fish?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to."</p>

<p>"I'll put you in the way of some splendid fishing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Tarpon! After that you'll return to England with
me. Sound good to you?"</p>

<p>"You're too generous, sir!" answered the young
fellow with deep feeling.</p>

<p>He was Larssen's man once again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">CONFESSION</span></h2>


<p>Rivi&egrave;re was at his glass-topped, bevel-edged
bench in the private biological
laboratory at Wiesbaden, surrounded by
his apparatus of experiment. At the moment he
was looking down with one eye through the high-power
immersion lens of his microscope at two
tiny blobs of life in a drop of water. From day
to day the salinity of the water was being slowly
altered, and this was only one of thousands of
experiments he had planned on the effect of changing
conditions of life on the elemental organisms.</p>

<p>Every day he was passing in review scores of
slides on which the elemental reaction to abnormal
conditions was unfolding itself for his observation.
Each drop of water was a world where the vital
spark was struggling against the harshness of
nature. Each drop of water embodied a fight of
primitive protoplasm against disease. Each drop
of water was contributing its tiny quota to the new
book of knowledge he hoped one day to give to his
fellow-men.</p>

<p>Like all trained microscopists, Rivi&egrave;re worked
with both eyes open. The amateur observer has
to screw one eye tight in order to avoid a confusion
of impressions, and quickly tires himself. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
trained man keeps both eyes open, and schools his
brain to concentrate on the one vision and ignore
the other. He sees only the miniature world at
the further end of his complex of lenses.</p>

<p>But Rivi&egrave;re, self-controlled as he was, could not
keep attention on his experimental slide. The
vision of the miniature world faded out, and through
the other eye came the impression of the outside
of the polished brass tube of the microscope; the
glass slide beyond, lit up by the reflector as though
with a searchlight; and the plate-glass bench
mirroring the cases of specimens and the shelves of
chemical reagents.</p>

<p>And then the material vision of both eyes faded
away, and he saw only the inner vision of Elaine
lying with bandaged eyes in the darkened room
of the Dr Hegelmann's surgical home. The great
specialist, pulling at his beard with his long,
delicately-chiselled fingers, so out of keeping with
the shapelessness of his bulky, untidy figure, had
taken Rivi&egrave;re aside and had given him orders in
that wonderfully musical voice of his.</p>

<p>"Fraulein is worrying&mdash;that is bad for the
recovery. I will not have her worried. You
must tell her that everything will come right&mdash;you
must make her smile again."</p>

<p>"But I'm only a casual acquaintance. We
met by mere chance a few days before the attack
at N&icirc;mes," Rivi&egrave;re had said.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you can do much for her. She
will listen to you gladly. You are no longer casual
acquaintances. I am an observer of human nature
as well as a surgeon, and I know that the mind is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the key to the bodily health. I know that <i>you</i> can
influence her. Talk to her freely&mdash;it will not tire
her. That is my order."</p>

<p>But Rivi&egrave;re had not been able to carry out the
spirit of the old man's shrewd command. When
he was by her bedside, a great constraint had come
upon him. What had been easy to embody in a
letter, was terribly difficult to frame in spoken
speech. Several times he had tried to open the
way to a confession. He knew it must scarify
Elaine, and he shrank from it. But yet it was
plain her mind was not at rest, and that was worse
for her than the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>He, too, must act the surgeon.</p>

<p>With sudden resolution, Rivi&egrave;re put away his
microscope and placed his experimental slides in
their air-tight incubating chamber. He changed
from his laboratory coat to his outdoor coat, and
made his way rapidly towards the surgical home.</p>

<p>As he crossed the Wilhelmstrasse&mdash;gay with its
alluring shops and its crowd of well-dressed, leisured
saunterers&mdash;a man came up with outstretched hand
to Rivi&egrave;re and then hesitated visibly.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but I thought for the moment
you were a friend of mine, a Mr Clifford Matheson.
I see now that I was mistaken by a very striking
resemblance."</p>

<p>"My half-brother."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it!" said the man, visibly relieved.
"Well, remember me to him when you see him.
Warren is my name&mdash;Major Warren."</p>

<p>"I'll certainly do so."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;good afternoon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not the first proof Rivi&egrave;re had had of the
safety of his new identity. Though Larssen and
Olive had penetrated the disguise, others who knew
him well, even his own clerks, had been perfectly
satisfied with the explanation of the "half-brother."</p>

<p>When he was ushered into the darkened room
at the surgical home, Elaine smiled greeting to him,
and the smile stabbed him with self-reproach. He
had come to wound her. There must be no further
delay. He must act the surgeon <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>Elaine half-sat, half-lay in a <i>chaise longue</i>. His
white lilac and fuchsia&mdash;those were her favourite
flowers he had discovered&mdash;were on a small table
by her side, scenting the room faintly but definitely.
She had a letter in her hands, which she asked him
to open and read to her.</p>

<p>"The nurse doesn't read English well," she
explained.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re looked first at the signature. "It's
from your friend Madge in Paris."</p>

<p>"Then it will be good reading."</p>

<p>As he read it out to her, he kept glancing now and
again at her face to note the effect of the words.
The letter was mostly a gay account of the girl's
doings in Paris&mdash;the amusements of the past week,
little scraps about mutual friends, theatrical gossip,
and so on. It was meant to cheer, but it did not
cheer. Rivi&egrave;re could see that Elaine was reading
into every sentence the might-have-been of her own
wrecked life. He hurried through it as quickly
as possible, and then they chatted for some time of
impersonal matters.</p>

<p>His words began to come from him with a curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
husky abruptness. Elaine felt the tension, and
knew that he had something important to tell her.
She sought to help him to it.</p>

<p>"Your journey to London," she said. "Did it
effect your purpose? You haven't told me much."</p>

<p>"I had the hardest fight of my life," he replied,
taking up her opening with relief. This would lead
him to what he had come to tell her.</p>

<p>"And you won?"</p>

<p>"I was beaten to my knees."</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound like you as I knew you at
Arles."</p>

<p>"The fight's not over yet. I managed to stumble
up again for a final round."</p>

<p>"May I know what the fight was about?"</p>

<p>"I want you to know every detail of it," he
answered swiftly. "I want your advice&mdash;your
help."</p>

<p>"My help?" There was a faint flush in her
cheeks below the bandages. "What can <i>I</i> do?"</p>

<p>He paused a moment before replying, seeking the
right beginning to his story.</p>

<p>"You remember at N&icirc;mes telling me that your
father had lost the last remnant of his fortune
speculating in one of the Clifford Matheson
companies?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I was surprised to find how different
you were to my conception of your brother."</p>

<p>"I am Clifford Matheson."</p>

<p>"I don't understand!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"I am Clifford Matheson. I took the name of
John Rivi&egrave;re because ... well, the reason for that
is one part of the story I have to tell you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>The pain, so evident in the drawn lines about her
mouth, made him pause. It was the first stroke
of the scalpel.</p>

<p>From outside the window came the care-free
chirping of the birds making their Spring nests and
telling the whole world of their happiness.</p>

<p>Presently she whispered "Go on," as though
she had steeled herself to bear the next stroke of
the knife.</p>

<p>"My reason was that I wanted to cut myself
loose&mdash;completely&mdash;from my life in the financial
world and from my married life. A sudden opportunity
came to me two days before I first met you
at Arles. I seized the opportunity and planned
to disappear entirely from my world. I arranged
evidence of a violent death, in the belief that it
would be accepted by my friends and by the Courts.
My wife would be freed; she would come into my
property; and I myself should be free to carry
out in quiet the scientific work I'd planned."</p>

<p>"Which was <i>the</i> reason?"</p>

<p>"The last."</p>

<p>"Your wife, then, is the woman I saw in the
C&ocirc;te d'Azur Rapide?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Elaine considered this in silence for some
moments. A question framed itself on her lips;
she hesitated; finally it came out:</p>

<p>"Then you were not happy together?"</p>

<p>"My marriage was a ghastly mistake. I was
quite unsuited to my wife.... But I made a bigger
mistake when I thought to cut loose from the life
I'd woven for myself. One thread pulled me back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
inexorably. I had half committed myself to a deal
involving five millions of the public's money with
Lars Larssen, the shipowner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Larssen!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"No; but he was once pointed out to me at the
Academy, the year the portrait of his little boy was
exhibited there. I could feel at once the tremendous
strength of will behind the man. Something beyond
the human. I was fascinated and repelled
at the one time. So that is the man who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who wants to drag you into a divorce court."</p>

<p>Elaine sat up rigid with shock. "A divorce
court! How&mdash;why? What possible&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Larssen doesn't stick at possibilities."</p>

<p>"I realise that, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll not let him drag you into court. Be quite
sure in your mind of that. But listen, Elaine!"
Her name came from him unconsciously. "Listen,
I want you to know every detail. It's your right."</p>

<p>Elaine flushed. Her voice held a delicate softness
as she answered: "I'll listen without
interruption."</p>

<p>Then Rivi&egrave;re told her of what had happened
since the crucial night of March 14th, omitting
nothing that she ought to know, sparing nothing
of himself. She listened quietly to his account of
the interview at the Rue Laffitte when he had, as
he thought, made the final settlement with Larssen;
and to the recital of what had occurred from the
moment of his seeing the notice in the <i>Europe
Chronicle</i> of the coming flotation of Hudson Bay
Transport, Ltd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not tell her of what he had seen through
the lighted window of Thornton Chase, but passed
on to the interview at Larssen's office.</p>

<p>She shuddered as he spoke of the shipowner's
brutal insinuations, and burst out: "It was
blackmail."</p>

<p>"Yes, but legalized blackmail."</p>

<p>"You never gave in to him on that ground?"</p>

<p>"Listen further."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re spoke of his wife's unexpected entry
into the office at Leadenhall Street, and the scene
that had followed when Olive and Larssen together
had bent their joint wills to the task of forcing him
to his knees. When he concluded on the signature
wrung out of the shipowner at the last moment,
Elaine cried her relief:</p>

<p>"Then you're not beaten down! I'm glad&mdash;I'm
glad!"</p>

<p>On his further conversation with Olive, Rivi&egrave;re
touched very briefly, merely indicating the terms
his wife had rigidly demanded.</p>

<p>"And that's how the matter rests at present,"
he ended bitterly. "I've taken away your livelihood;
and dragged your name into this unsavoury
mire; and there's no finality reached.... But
I'll get this tangle straightened out somehow, if I
have to choke Larssen to do it!"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re had strode over to the window&mdash;not to
look out, because the curtains were close-drawn,
but from sheer force of habit. He turned round
sharply as a half-whispered question&mdash;an utterly
unexpected question&mdash;came from Elaine.</p>

<p>"Why did you leave me so abruptly at Arles?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re's blood leapt hot in his veins and he
answered recklessly: "Because I loved you!
Loved you from the first moment we met! And I
hadn't the right to love you. I wasn't running
away from <i>you</i>&mdash;I was running away from <i>myself</i>."</p>

<p>"Now I see. I thought then.... And when
you offered to devote your life to me? You remember
that, don't you?" She was trembling
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I meant every word of it!"</p>

<p>"It was not pity for me? I want the truth&mdash;nothing
but the truth! Oh, if I could only see you
now, to know if it were the truth!" Her hands
went up impulsively to the bandages over her
eyes, then dropped helplessly to her side as she
remembered they must on no account be touched.</p>

<p>"As God hears me, it was not pity but love!"
he answered with passionate sincerity.</p>

<p>"Then you give me something to live for!"</p>

<p>Her meaning thundered upon him.</p>

<p>"You intended to&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When my money was exhausted."</p>

<p>"I never dreamt!"</p>

<p>"What else was left for me?"</p>

<p>"Surely you knew that I'd provide for you?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't accept it&mdash;then."</p>

<p>"You'll accept it now?"</p>

<p>"I must think."</p>

<p>"I insist! I claim it as my right! You wouldn't
torture me all my life with the thought that I'd
driven you to&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't say it."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re took her hand and bent to kiss it reverently.
There was silence for many moments&mdash;a
silence of deep sympathy. Elaine's flushed cheeks
told Rivi&egrave;re more plainly than words what she was
feeling.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she said at length. "So glad
to know."</p>

<p>"And I'm glad to have told you."</p>

<p>"I shall get my sight back now. I have something
to live for."</p>

<p>"Please God, you will."</p>

<p>"I feel it. I have something to live for.... Dear
John!"</p>

<p>She sought to take his hand in hers, but he rose
abruptly from beside her couch and strode away.</p>

<p>"We're forgetting!" he exclaimed bitterly. "I'm
still Clifford Matheson."</p>

<p>"Not to me."</p>

<p>"Nothing can alter the fact."</p>

<p>"Let us live in dreamland awhile," she pleaded
gently.</p>

<p>"But the awakening must come."</p>

<p>"We have till May 3rd."</p>

<p>"Till May 3rd.... And then?"</p>

<p>"And then you will go back to the fight."</p>

<p>"Yes. But Larssen won't relent. Nor will my
wife."</p>

<p>"Something may happen before then."</p>

<p>"We must make things happen."</p>

<p>"We?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>There was silence again for some moments. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
came back to her side. She sought for his hand,
and he let her take it in hers.</p>

<p>Gradually the glow of an idea lit up her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I think I see the way out!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What's the plan?"</p>

<p>"Will you trust to me&mdash;trust to me implicitly
without asking for reasons?"</p>

<p>"I'd trust you to the world's end!"</p>

<p>"Then write to your wife for me."</p>

<p>"To say&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"To say that I want to meet her."</p>

<p>"But she'd never come!"</p>

<p>"I know her better than you do. I saw her in
the train that morning&mdash;heard her speak. It told
me a great deal. We women know one another's
springs of actions. If you write the letter I dictate,
she'll come!"</p>

<p>"If she came, it would only exhaust you and
hinder your recovery. Dr Hegelmann would certainly
not allow it if he knew. He's given me
strict orders to chase away worry from you."</p>

<p>"It would worry me still more not to write that
letter.... I shall be fighting for you, and that will
help me to get back my sight. Please!"</p>

<p>"Then I'll fetch pen and paper and write for
you. But we must let a week go by before posting.
Every day will give you new strength."</p>

<p>"Through your love," she whispered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">WHITE LILAC</span></h2>


<p>Happiness is a veil of iridescent gossamer
draped over the ugliness of reality.
Happiness is rooted in illusion&mdash;in the
ignoring of harsh fact and jarring circumstance,
and the perception only of what is beautiful and
joyous.</p>

<p>Happiness is an impressionist painting. One
takes a muddy, sullen river flanked by rotting
wharves and grimy factories and huddled, festering
slums, and under the mantle of evening and the
veil of illusion one creates a "Nocturne in Silver."
The eye of the artist finds equal beauty in the
Thames by sordid Southwark and the Adriatic
lapping Venice in her soft caress. The common
phrase has it as "the seeing eye"&mdash;but more justly
it is the ignoring eye. The artist ignores the harsh
and the ugly, and transfers to his canvas only
the harmonious and the poetic. He epitomises
happiness.</p>

<p>Little children know this truth instinctively.
They find their highest happiness in make-believe.
A child of the slums with a rag-doll and a few beads
and a scrap of faded finery can make for herself a
world of fairyland. She is a princess clothed in
shimmering silk and hung about with pearls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
diamonds. She is courted by a knight in golden
armour. She is married amidst the acclamations
of a loyal populace. She is the mother of a king-to-be.
She is radiantly happy.</p>

<p>And in her self-created world of make-believe
she is far wiser than these grown-ups who insist
with obstinate complacency on "seeing things as
they are." They take pride in being disillusioned.</p>

<p>Not realising that happiness is bowered in
illusion.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Let us live in dreamland awhile," Elaine had
said with the wisdom of a little child.</p>

<p>It was tacitly agreed to by Rivi&egrave;re. When together,
they combined to ignore the tangle of ugly
circumstance and the harsh struggle to come. For
the time being they were in fancy two lovers with
no barrier between and the world smiling joyously
upon them.</p>

<p>After a full day's work in his laboratory, he would
come to her side and answer her questions with the
tenderness of a lover.</p>

<p>"You've brought me white lilac again," she said
one day as he entered. "How did you first guess
that white lilac is my favourite flower?"</p>

<p>"White lilac is yourself," he answered.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Every woman suggests a flower. One sees
many roses&mdash;little bud roses, and big, buxom,
full-blown roses, and wild, free-blowing roses.
One sees many white camellias, and heavy-scented
tuberoses, and opulent Parma violets, and gorgeous
tiger-lilies&mdash;those have been the women of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
world. One sees many marigolds and cornflowers
and poppies. But I've seen only one white lilac&mdash;you.
White lilac is the fresh young Spring. And
yet it is a woman grown. White lilac is sweet and
tender and gracious. White lilac is so faint in
perfume that any other scented flower would
smother it, and yet its fragrance lives in my
memory beyond any other. White lilac is yourself."</p>

<p>"How many-sided you are! Financier, and
scientist, and now ... and now poet."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;lover."</p>

<p>"Then love must be living poetry."</p>

<p>"That many-sidedness is my weakness."</p>

<p>"I don't want it otherwise."</p>

<p>"The success race has to be run in blinkers.
One must see only the goal ahead. There must
be no looking to right or left."</p>

<p>"If success means that, then success is bought
too dearly.... Dear John, I don't want you otherwise
than you are. I love you for your weakness
and not your strength. That's the mother-love
in a woman."</p>

<p>"I can do so little for you."</p>

<p>"So little? You've made this sick-room an
enchanted castle for me! I dread the time when
I shall have to leave it. But we won't speak of
that&mdash;that's forbidden ground."</p>

<p>"We'll speak only of the world we've created
for ourselves. It's a whole planet with only you
and I for its sole inhabitants. The planet Earth
is far away in space&mdash;just a cold white star amongst
a wilderness of others."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"I used to think you cold and bloodless&mdash;that
was at Arles and N&icirc;mes."</p>

<p>"We were far apart then. We were next to one
another in the physical plane, and yet a million
miles away in the plane of reality. Only the
invisible things are the realities of life.... You
were to leave N&icirc;mes the next day, and I never
expected to see you again."</p>

<p>"You remember the arena at Arles, at sunset,
when you climbed up to stand beside me. Did
you know then that I wanted you to speak to me?</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew that. But there was the barrier
between us."</p>

<p>"Were we destined to meet, do you think?"</p>

<p>"<i>Quien sabe?</i>"</p>

<p>There was a long silence between them&mdash;a silence
which held no constraint, a silence that exists
only between those in deep sympathy. Silence
is the test of true friendship.</p>

<p>"I was so glad to know," she said at length.
"It outweighed everything else."</p>

<p>There was no need to put her thoughts more
explicitly.</p>

<p>"Didn't you guess before?" he answered gently.</p>

<p>"I couldn't be sure, and the doubt tortured me.
I thought it might only be pity. Such a world of
difference!"</p>

<p>"You're sure now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; your voice has told me more than your
words. Even the notes of the birds soften when
they...." She left the sentence uncompleted.</p>

<p>"It was Larssen who brought us together," he
meditated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Larssen! He dominates us both. He seems
to hold us in his hands. He's like ... like Fate.
Pitiless, relentless."</p>

<p>"And, like Fate, to be fought to the end."</p>

<p>"I love you for your weakness, and yet I love
you as the fighter. How contradictory it sounds!"</p>

<p>"Such seeming contradiction comes from elision.
One leaves out the train of thought in between.
Between you and me there's no need for the lengthy
explanation. There's scarcely need for words at
all."</p>

<p>"But yet I love to hear you speak. Your words
heal."</p>

<p>"Dr Hegelmann is shrewd as well as marvellously
skilful. He said to me to-day: 'I can see you are
obeying orders. Fra&uuml;lein needs your doctoring as
much as my surgery.'"</p>

<p>"He's a dear man as well as a great man."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re burst out impulsively: "But the days
fly by and my Cinderella's midnight rushes nearer!"</p>

<p>"Not yours alone. Mine too!"</p>

<p>"And when our fairy garments turn back to
rags?"</p>

<p>"We'll have had our hour&mdash;<i>our hour</i>! No one
can take that away from us. Its memories&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To me it will be the memory of white lilac."</p>

<p>Elaine felt for the flowers in the tall vase by her
side, and broke off a small spray.</p>

<p>"Keep this in symbol."</p>

<p>She kissed it before she gave it into his hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">A CHALLENGE</span></h2>


<p>Olive was at her dressing-table at Thornton
Chase, looking searchingly into a mirror.</p>

<p>That afternoon she had been dragged
unwillingly to the consulting-room of a Cavendish
Square physician by her father, who had insisted
on having "a tonic or something" prescribed for
her. The physician was one of those men who
achieve a fashionable practice by an outrageous
bluntness&mdash;a calculatedly outrageous bluntness.
He had found that women like to be bullied by
their doctors.</p>

<p>"You're drugging yourself to a lunatic asylum,"
he had told her after a very brief examination.</p>

<p>"Drugs? I, doctor?" she had replied with a
little surprised raising of her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Don't prevaricate! Don't try to deceive <i>me</i>.
You look a perfect wreck. All the signs of
it. Come, which is it&mdash;morphia, hashish or
what?"</p>

<p>"You're mistaken, doctor. I'm run down, that's
all. I want a tonic."</p>

<p>"And I'm a busy man." He rose brusquely
and strode to the door to open it for her. "I must
wish you good afternoon!"</p>

<p>Olive caved in. "Well, perhaps now and again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
when I feel absolutely in need of it, I do take a
little stimulant," she conceded.</p>

<p>The physician cross-examined her ruthlessly.
Finally he prescribed an absolute cessation of drug-taking,
and gave her a special dietary and mixture
of his own which would help to create a distaste for
the morphia.</p>

<p>"Remember," he warned her as they parted,
"you're looking an absolute wreck. Everyone can
see it. Three months more of the same pace would
make you a hag."</p>

<p>Olive was searching her mirror for refutation of
his words, trying to stroke away the flabbiness of
her cheek and chin muscles and the heavy strained
shadows under the eyes. Yes, it was true&mdash;the
drug was stamping its mastery on her face, grinning
from behind her eyelids.</p>

<p>She must fight it down!</p>

<p>The resolution came hot upon the thought that
Clifford had noticed the change in her. No doubt
he would like her to drug herself to death. That
would suit his plans to perfection. Then he would
be free to marry that Verney woman. She must
fight down her craving for the drug if only to spite
Clifford.</p>

<p>With a curious vindictive satisfaction, Olive
took out her hypodermic syringe from its secret
place and smashed it to pieces with the bedroom
poker. She gathered up the fragments of glass and
silver and threw them into the fire, heaping coals
over them.</p>

<p>As she was poking the fire, her maid knocked and
entered with a letter. The postmark was Wiesbaden;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the handwriting was her husband's. No doubt
a further appeal to her feelings, she reflected contemptuously.
But the letter proved to be from
Elaine&mdash;written at the invalid's dictation by Rivi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>Olive read it with a mixture of indignation and
very lively curiosity. The letter was no appeal
to her feelings&mdash;rather, a challenge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think we ought to meet," it said. "I have
many things to tell you of which you know nothing
at present&mdash;unless you have guessed. They affect
your husband's position very materially. Unfortunately
I am confined to a sick-room, else I
should have come to London before this in order
to call upon you."</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>Olive's indignation was based on the obvious
deduction that Rivi&egrave;re had confided completely
in the girl. Her curiosity was roused by the thoughts
of what she could be like to exert such a fascination,
and what she could have to say. Perhaps the
letter was a ruse to see Olive and then make another
appeal for pity. Well, in that case there would be
a very delicious pleasure in giving an absolute
refusal&mdash;a pleasure one could taste in anticipation
and linger over in execution. One could play with
the girl a little&mdash;pretend to be influenced, hesitate,
ask for time to consider, raise hopes, fan them, and
then administer the <i>coup de grace</i>.</p>

<p>To see Elaine promised an exciting diversion,
very welcome just now when Olive had to give up
the customary stimulation of the drug.</p>

<p>These considerations united in deciding her to
travel to Wiesbaden. She would cross to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Continent alone, her father and her maid being left
at home. Sir Francis knew nothing as yet of
Rivi&egrave;re&mdash;for Olive had told him nothing. She
had an unlimited capacity for keeping her own
counsel when it suited her purpose.</p>

<p>The next day saw her <i>en route</i> for Wiesbaden,
following a letter to that effect to Elaine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">WOMEN'S WEAPONS</span></h2>


<p>Olive had a genius for dress. Her gowns
had not only style, which might be due to
the costumier, but also effect, which is
entirely personal. They invariably harmonized
with the occasion, or with the way she sought
to mould the occasion. Sometimes she had
snapped her fingers at fashion, taken matters
with the high hand&mdash;and carried the occasion
triumphantly. The illustrated weeklies published
portraits of her when the theatrical market was
dull.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Olive that although she
was going to visit a blinded girl with bandaged
eyes, yet when she left the Hotel Quisisana at Wiesbaden
for the surgical home she had dressed studiously
for the occasion. The part to be dressed
was that of "the outraged wife." The gown was
of clinging grey cashmere, cut with simplicity and
dignity, with touches of soft violet to suggest
sensitive inner feelings. The hat was of grey straw
with willowy feathers drooping softly from it.
She wore no jewellery beyond a simple pearl brooch
and her wedding-ring.</p>

<p>Dressed thus, she felt ready for any cruelty.</p>

<p>A nurse showed her into the room where Elaine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
lay on her <i>chaise longue</i> with bandages hiding the
upper part of her face.</p>

<p>"Do you suffer much?" asked Olive softly,
when the nurse had left them alone.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;there is no pain now. Only
waiting for the day of release, when my bandages
are to be removed."</p>

<p>"It must be terrible to know that one's sight can
never be restored."</p>

<p>"I don't expect it. But I shall have a fair
measure of sight. Dr. Hegelmann promises it."</p>

<p>"Still, it's best not to raise one's hopes too high.
Doctors have to be optimistic as part of their trade.
I remember one very sad case where&mdash;&mdash;" Olive
stopped herself abruptly as though her tongue
had run away with her. "Pardon me&mdash;I was
forgetting."</p>

<p>"I know," affirmed Elaine happily.</p>

<p>"You know what?"</p>

<p>"That I shall have a fair measure of sight. The
doctor tells me recovery depends largely on the
mental condition. I was worrying myself up till
a few days ago, but now I'm supremely happy.
So I shall recover&mdash;I've something to live for, you
see!" Elaine reached for the vase by her side and
raised a spray of white lilac to breathe in its
fragrance.</p>

<p>The happiness so evident on Elaine's lips stirred
Olive uneasily.</p>

<p>"Then you've had good news from outside?
I'm very glad to hear it," she said.</p>

<p>"Good news? Why, yes, thanks to you! I
want first to thank you for your generosity. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
was worrying so until I heard the news from
John."</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"Your husband. You see, he will always be
John Rivi&egrave;re to me. That's how I knew him
during these wonderful days at Arles and N&icirc;mes."
Her voice became dreamy with memories. "I met
him first, you know, at the arena at Arles. We sat
for hours in the flooding sunlight reconstructing
our pictures of the past. The stone tiers were
vivid orange in the sunlight and deep purple in
the shadows. A deep, greyish purple. We sat
apart, I longing for him to speak to me and exchange
thoughts. But there was no one to introduce us.
How stupid convention is! At sunset we climbed
up to the topmost tier and stood together as though
on an island tower in the midst of a sea of marshland.
I ached to speak to him, and still we remained
silent and apart. That night came the introduction
I longed for. I was wandering about the
dark, narrow lanes of Arles when a half-drunken
peasant tried to attack me. I cried out for help,
and John came to my defence with his strong arm
and his clenched fist. There was no need for
formal introduction after that. We found we
were staying at the same hotel...."</p>

<p>Olive made no comment.</p>

<p>Elaine continued: "N&icirc;mes is fragrant with its
memories for me. The Jardin de la Fontaine,
the Maison Carr&eacute;e, the Druids' Tower, the dear
Villa Cl&eacute;mentine! There was a little pebbly garden
and a fountain by which we used to sit for lunch&mdash;there
were two lazy old goldfish I used to feed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
crumbs. Darby and Joan!... Those memories
of N&icirc;mes wash away the burn of the vitriol, now
that you've been so kind and generous."</p>

<p>"I fail to understand," said Olive coldly. The
interview was shaping itself very differently to
what she had expected.</p>

<p>Elaine turned her bandaged head towards her
in surprise. "But John tells me you've offered
to release him!"</p>

<p>"Offered to release him! My dear Miss Verney,
Clifford must have been saying pretty things to
soothe you. I'm sorry to pour cold water on your
dreams, but you'll have to learn the truth some
time, and it's kinder to tell you now. Release
him! My husband is not an employee to be handed
over to somebody else at a moment's notice. There
are such things as marriage laws ... and divorce
laws."</p>

<p>"Aren't we talking at cross-purposes, Mrs
Matheson? I quite understand all that. John
tells me that you have promised to divorce him.
That's very generous of you."</p>

<p>"You seem to ignore the point that a divorce
suit involves a co-respondent."</p>

<p>"No; not at all. I wanted to see you in order
to thank you; and then to arrange the details so
that the matter can go through with as little trouble
as possible. Of course, after your kindness, I
shall let the suit go undefended."</p>

<p>Olive searched the bandaged face of her rival
with merciless scrutiny. But the blinded girl
seemed unconscious of that look of stabbing hatred
and suspicion. She was apparently smiling happily&mdash;weaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> day-dreams. Her hand went out to
the vase of white lilac caressingly.</p>

<p>For that was the part Elaine had set herself to
play for the sake of the man she loved. He had
been beaten down to his knees by Larssen and
Olive in the shipowner's office because he had had
Elaine to protect. To save her from the mire of
the divorce court he had had to give in and sign
at Larssen's dictation.</p>

<p>Now she was determined to release him for free
action. Whatever it might cost her in self-respect,
she was going to make Olive believe that a divorce
suit was the one thing she most ardently
desired.</p>

<p>"I shall let the divorce suit go undefended,"
she had said, smiling happily.</p>

<p>Olive made a decisive effort to regain the whip-hand.
"Divorce by collusion is out of the
question!" she retorted sharply. "The King's
Proctor sees to that. You don't imagine that it's
sufficient merely to say you don't defend the suit?
There must be evidence before the Court."</p>

<p>Elaine bowed her head.</p>

<p>"There is evidence," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"At Arles, N&icirc;mes, or here?"</p>

<p>"At N&icirc;mes."</p>

<p>"Then my husband lied to me! He swore to me
on his word of honour that there was nothing
between you!"</p>

<p>"John is very chivalrous."</p>

<p>"You tell me he lied?"</p>

<p>"I don't know just what he said to you.... And
I want you to realise this: the fault was on my side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
I loved him. I love him still. I shall love him
always. Always, whatever happens."</p>

<p>Then she added, because in the playing of her
part she had determined to spare herself no degradation:
"I care nothing for what people say.
They may sneer and point at me, but nothing
shall keep us apart."</p>

<p>Olive went chalk-white with anger. She had not
travelled the long journey to Wiesbaden to be
fooled in this way. The ground had been cut from
under her feet by Elaine's most unexpected attitude,
and the situation needed some drastic counter-move
on her part.</p>

<p>"A pretty story!" she retorted. "If you
imagine your childish bluffing would deceive me,
you've a lot to learn yet! Clifford was not lying,
and you are! That's the long and short of
it!"</p>

<p>"Then call him here and ask him before me!"</p>

<p>Olive saw her opportunity. She could find out
Rivi&egrave;re's address from Dr. Hegelmann or from one
of the staff of the nursing home, and go to confront
him before Elaine could see and warn him of the
new development. It would be strategic to allay
suspicion of her coming move, however.</p>

<p>"I want to see nothing more of Clifford," she
replied. "We've agreed to part. He's to go on
with his life as John Rivi&egrave;re. If you like to marry
him as John Rivi&egrave;re, you're quite welcome to do
so as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>"You mean that you want to get permission
from the Courts to presume death, and then take
possession of his property?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any such arrangement is entirely a private
matter between my husband and myself."</p>

<p>"I doubt if John would agree to that arrangement
now. He would make you a suitable allowance,
of course."</p>

<p>Olive could have choked this girl lying helpless
in her chair, and yet holding the whip-hand in
their triangle of conflicting interests. She felt as
if she had been tripped and thrown without a word
of warning. To have travelled to Wiesbaden to
play the outraged wife sitting in judgment on the
woman who had sinned, and now&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>If only Larssen were here to advise her!</p>

<p>She tried another move, altering her voice to as
much sweetness as she could command under
her white-hot anger.</p>

<p>"My dear, I appreciate your feelings," she said.
"You want to fight for the man you love. You'd
even blacken your character for his sake. You'd
face the sneers of the world for his sake. I admire
you for it. It brings us nearer together. I admit
that I had misjudged you a little. That was
because I hadn't seen you and spoken to you.
Now I know what a fine character you are, and I
want you not to bring unnecessary suffering on
yourself. I'm older than you, and I've seen very
much more of the world. I know that a good
woman can't live with a married man for long.
The situation becomes intolerable after a time.
One can't ignore the conventions of the world one
lives in."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to face all that. I've counted the
cost."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"But is Clifford ready to? Think of him. Think
of his work. He would not only be ostracised
socially, but also scientifically. His work would
be ignored. You would destroy his life-work.
You would kill his ambition!"</p>

<p>Olive's thrust went home, though not to the
exact point she aimed at. Elaine remained silent
as the thought raced through her of how Olive, if
she deemed it to her own interests, might kill
Rivi&egrave;re's work.</p>

<p>"So you see, dear," pursued Olive, "that our
interests are really very much the same. We both
care deeply for Clifford. We both want to help him
in his life-work. We both want to do our best for
him. That means that we must pull together and
not against one another. We must each of us
think matters out coolly and dispassionately. Isn't
that what you think as well as I?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Elaine.</p>

<p>"Then I'll say good-bye for the present. I
mustn't stay longer or Dr. Hegelmann will call me
over the coals. I have to remember that you're
not altogether strong again yet. So I'll say good-bye
now and call again to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Do you like lilies? I must send you some.
As I passed a florist's in the Wilhelmstrasse I saw
some splendid tiger-lilies. Good-bye, my dear."</p>

<p>Elaine waited with feverish impatience for three
minutes to elapse, when she judged Olive would
be clear of the house. Then she rang a bell by her
side. She must get a message through to Rivi&egrave;re
to let him know of the new development in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
situation before Olive could reach him with <i>her</i>
story. Rivi&egrave;re knew nothing beforehand of Elaine's
plan of self-accusation; it was vital that he should
know of it now, when it had been carried to so
effective an end.</p>

<p>The nurse came to answer the call.</p>

<p>"I want to telephone," said Elaine in her halting
German.</p>

<p>"But the telephone is downstairs!"</p>

<p>"You must lead me there, nurse."</p>

<p>"No; I cannot do that. It is against orders.
The doctor has forbidden you to leave this room,
Fra&uuml;lein."</p>

<p>"I must! I tell you I must! It's&mdash;&mdash;It's&mdash;oh,
what is the German for 'vital?'"</p>

<p>The nurse shook her head uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>Elaine rose from her couch and stumbled with
outstretched arms against the nurse.</p>

<p>"Please lead me to the telephone and get me my
number!" she cried in an agony of anxiety.</p>

<p>"It is against orders. Come, you must lie down
again and keep quiet."</p>

<p>There was a brisk rap at the door, and Dr. Hegelmann
came in to see how his patient was progressing.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he exclaimed, seeing Elaine
standing up and the nurse trying to persuade her
to return to her couch.</p>

<p>"Doctor, please let me telephone!"</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To Mr Rivi&egrave;re. I must speak to him quickly&mdash;I
<i>must</i>!"</p>

<p>"Nurse, do as Fra&uuml;lein asks," he ordered briefly.</p>

<p>The nurse made no comment, but led her patient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
downstairs at once, found the telephone number
of the laboratory at which Rivi&egrave;re had his research-bench,
and called for the connection.</p>

<p>"What do they say?" asked Elaine after a
torturing wait.</p>

<p>"They ask me to hold the line."</p>

<p>Again a very long wait.</p>

<p>"What do they say?" asked Elaine again.</p>

<p>"Wait a little.... Yes, I'm here." ... "Mr
Rivi&egrave;re has just left the laboratory."</p>

<p>"Where has he gone?" prompted Elaine.</p>

<p>"Where has he gone?" ... "They do not
know."</p>

<p>"But I <i>must</i> find him!" cried Elaine. "Try
his hotel, please."</p>

<p>The hotel people knew nothing of Rivi&egrave;re's
whereabouts.</p>

<p>"Say to them to give him the message to telephone
me the moment he arrives."</p>

<p>The nurse gave the message and the telephone
number of the home. Suddenly she felt her patient
sway heavily against her. The reaction had set in
from the feverish tension of the last hour&mdash;Elaine
had fainted away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE COUNTER-MOVE</span></h2>


<p>Olive, as Elaine had guessed, went straight
to Rivi&egrave;re's laboratory to confront him. Not
finding him there, she made her way to his
hotel and again drew blank.</p>

<p>This left her uncertain as to her next movements.
Should she return to the nursing home, and wait
about in its neighbourhood in the hope of meeting
her husband on his way to see Elaine? That course
seemed undignified. Should she try the laboratory
once more? That seemed a mere waste of precious
time. Should she walk the length of the Wilhelmstrasse
on the chance of crossing him there? That
seemed a very long shot.</p>

<p>On the whole she judged it advisable to return
to the Hotel Quisisana, and from there to hold
her husband by telephone. Accordingly she said
to the hotel porter at Rivi&egrave;re's hotel:</p>

<p>"When Mr Rivi&egrave;re comes in, tell him to 'phone
up at once No. 352."</p>

<p>"Already haf I taken zat message, lady."</p>

<p>"To 'phone up No. 352?" asked Olive in
surprise.</p>

<p>The porter referred to a slate by his side.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, lady, I am wrong. Ze number
gifen me before is 392."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive opened her purse, took out a gold piece,
and passed it into his hand.</p>

<p>"Alter it to 352," she said.</p>

<p>The porter hesitated, looked at the 20-mark
piece, looked around the hall to see if anyone were
observing him, and then said in a very low voice:
"Very goot. Vat name shall I say?"</p>

<p>"Mrs Matheson." She then left for the
Quisisana.</p>

<p>And that was why Rivi&egrave;re never received Elaine's
message, and why he went first to call on his wife.</p>

<p>Olive received him in her private sitting-room.
She was horribly uncertain what line of action she
ought to take, now that Elaine had so completely
reversed the situation. Her nerves, weakened by
the almost continuous drugging of the last few
months, were all a-quiver. The threat of the
"suitable allowance" drove her to frenzy. She
wanted somebody to vent her rage upon, and there
was nobody to serve the purpose. For a moment
she regretted she had not brought her maid with
her to Wiesbaden.</p>

<p>Her attitude must depend on Clifford's attitude.
But, whatever line of action was to be taken, one
point seemed clear. She must be calm with Clifford&mdash;forgiving.
She must play for the quixotic side
of his nature. She had better be even cordial.</p>

<p>Accordingly she gave him a wifely kiss when he
entered.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re wondered how Elaine could have worked
this miracle for him.</p>

<p>"You've seen Miss Verney, I suppose?" he
suggested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and I must admit I was very pleasantly
surprised. I had formed an altogether wrong
opinion of her."</p>

<p>"Then I'm glad you met.... You see now that
your suspicions of her were absolutely unfounded."</p>

<p>Olive knew the sincerity in Rivi&egrave;re's tone. So
it was just as she had guessed&mdash;the girl had been
attempting a daring bluff by her self-accusation.</p>

<p>"Absolutely unfounded," agreed Olive. "That's
why I want to forgive and forget."</p>

<p>She gave him one of her sweetest smiles.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re was puzzled. He had an uneasy feeling
that something very vital was being kept from him.
He noticed his wife's hands all a-quiver, and that
fact jarred against the calm of her words.</p>

<p>He answered: "You've changed your attitude
towards me very quickly. I take it you only
arrived in Wiesbaden to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but it's more than a fortnight since that
scene in Larssen's office. I've had time to reflect
over things. I was too hasty in what I said then.
You must remember that you sprang a surprise on
me when you returned in that secret way, and
naturally I was put out. I always hate to be taken
at a disadvantage, as you ought to know by now.... Clifford,
when <i>will</i> you learn to read women as
well as you read men? If you'd approached me a
little differently; if you hadn't assumed I was
hostile to you; if you'd only taken me a little
more patiently and pressed your point more insistently&mdash;&mdash;" Olive
paused significantly.</p>

<p>"Which point?"</p>

<p>"Surely you remember?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"There were many points we discussed."</p>

<p>"<i>The</i> point&mdash;when you were generous enough
to offer to start our life afresh."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re looked keenly at his wife. Her eyes were
downcast, as though it hurt her modesty to have
to make overtures. There was a faint blush on
her cheeks.</p>

<p>He began to feel he had been a brute.</p>

<p>She continued: "You ought to have given me
a day to think it over, instead of rushing away as
you did. You ought to have known that a woman's
pride won't let her yield without being pressed
to yield. I wanted you to press me; I wanted to
make a fresh start with you; I wanted to help you
with your big work! Clifford when <i>will</i> you learn
to read a woman?"</p>

<p>"What's your suggestion now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My suggestion is your own&mdash;to wipe out the
past, and start our married life afresh. A few days
ago I went to see a doctor&mdash;a man in Cavendish
Square who has a big reputation for women's
ailments. Father insisted on my going to consult
him, and he was right. I ought to have gone to
him months ago."</p>

<p>"What did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"The long and short of it is that I must give up
society engagements and all excitements of that
kind, and lead a very quiet life. I ought to go to
some quiet place away from people, with someone
with me whom I care for and who cares for me.
That was the gist of his prescription. Of course
I have a special dietary and medicine to take, but
that's only incidental!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Her voice held a pathetic braveness, and Rivi&egrave;re
was touched by it.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," he murmured.</p>

<p>"It's hard on me, to give up all that."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"It's meant a big fight with myself. Look at
me&mdash;you can see it in my face. I'm looking a
wreck."</p>

<p>"The kind of life you've been leading would crack
up any constitution. I'm glad you've taken advice
in time."</p>

<p>"It was the turning-point for me."</p>

<p>"Where are you going for your rest-cure?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that for you to decide, Clifford dear?"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re roused himself with an effort akin to
that of Ulysses in the house of Circe.</p>

<p>"I'd better be quite frank with you," he
answered. "I can't live with you again as man
and wife."</p>

<p>"I realise your feeling so well. I admire you
for it. It brings us nearer together. You feel
yourself under an obligation to Miss Verney because
of her intervention between you and that vitriol-thrower.
You don't know just how you can repay
it. Obviously you can't offer her money. A girl
of her finely-strung feelings couldn't take a pension
from you.... Now I have a suggestion that
clears away the difficulty completely."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Rivi&egrave;re non-committally.</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> make her an allowance. Let the money
pass through my hands to her. It needn't be a
large allowance. I daresay she could live nicely
on three or four pounds a week. If you agree, I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
go and arrange it myself, so as not to hurt her
feelings."</p>

<p>That would be indeed revenge on Elaine! To
buy back Clifford for a paltry four pounds a week&mdash;to
have the delicate pleasure of doling out the
money in the role of Lady Bountiful! She had a
mental vision of the sweet little letters she could
write to Elaine when she enclosed the monthly
cheque&mdash;letters so sweet that they would sear.</p>

<p>But Rivi&egrave;re answered abruptly: "What did
Miss Verney say to you to make such a complete
change in your attitude towards her?"</p>

<p>"We chatted together this afternoon and came
to realise one another's point of view&mdash;that was all.
It was perfectly natural. A blind girl ... helpless ... without resources of her own.... Do you think I'm flint?"</p>

<p>"Then she made some appeal to you?"</p>

<p>"Clifford, dear, I don't think you and I ought to
discuss what passed between Miss Verney and
myself in the sick-room this afternoon. Some
things are sacred."</p>

<p>"I must know this: did she suggest the idea of
the allowance or did you?"</p>

<p>Olive hesitated as to how she should answer that
question. It was very tempting to say that Elaine
had suggested it&mdash;but decidedly risky. Rivi&egrave;re
might ask the girl point-blank. It was better to be
prudent in this game of strategy, and accordingly
she replied:</p>

<p>"I don't think you ought to ask me that question."</p>

<p>"I must see Miss Verney at once," said Rivi&egrave;re
decisively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"But we must think of her feelings. She's very
sensitive, very highly-strung. Wouldn't it be
kinder to let <i>me</i> arrange it?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"I ask you this for her sake!"</p>

<p>"Still, I must see her at once."</p>

<p>"As your wife, I ask you to let me end the matter
once and for all. Clifford dear, I must speak out
frankly, though I hate to have to do it. Listen
to me quietly while I try to put the situation to you
in the proper light.... You're in love with
Miss Verney&mdash;I know it. It's hard for you to have
to cut loose&mdash;very hard. But for her sake you
<i>must</i> cut loose. <i>Now, at once.</i> Matters can't go on
as they are. I know perfectly well that the relations
between you are absolutely innocent&mdash;I haven't
a word to breathe against her character now that
I've seen her and really know her. But things
can't go on as they are. You must put yourself
aside and consider her alone. You must think of
her reputation. People will begin to talk."</p>

<p>"What people?" asked Rivi&egrave;re uneasily.</p>

<p>"At the nursing home I can see that they regard
you as lovers. A woman realises a point like that
instinctively. No word was said, but I <i>know</i>.... Things
can't remain stationary in a situation of
that kind. You know it as well as I do. You are
a man of strong passions.... Miss Verney is
highly-strung, very impressionable."</p>

<p>And then Olive made her one big mistake. She
added: "She confessed to me that&mdash;how shall I
put it?&mdash;that it would be dangerous for her to see
more of you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Verney told you that?"</p>

<p>"In effect."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!"</p>

<p>"It's as true as I sit here!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it for a moment!"</p>

<p>"She said even more than that."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That she would be ready to live with you,
divorce or no divorce. Don't you see the danger
now? Clifford, I appeal to your chivalry! For
her sake cut loose now, at once, before it's too late!
Say good-bye to her by letter; leave me to arrange
the allowance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you I must see her!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i>!"</p>

<p>Olive lost control of herself. "I'm your wife!
I forbid you to!" she ordered sharply.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re stiffened. "You told me a fortnight ago
you never wanted to see me again."</p>

<p>"I've changed my mind!"</p>

<p>"There's a reason for the change."</p>

<p>"I've told you the reasons!"</p>

<p>"Not all the reasons."</p>

<p>"D'you doubt my word?"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re's business training made him recognize
the true meaning of that phrase. He had heard
it so many times before from men who were planning
some shady trick. He answered decisively: "I've
the right to hear from Miss Verney herself what she
said to you this afternoon, and I'm going to hear it.
That's final!"</p>

<p>Olive was now chalk-white with rage. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
nerve of her body was quivering, but by a supreme
effort she regained control over her words.</p>

<p>"You're insulting me!" she returned. "You
doubt my word when I tell you that Miss Verney is
ready to become your mistress. Very well, come
with me and I'll repeat it in front of her."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You're afraid of the test!"</p>

<p>"I'll not discuss such a matter."</p>

<p>"You're afraid of the test!"</p>

<p>"I'll not have that insult put upon her."</p>

<p>"It's true! I'll swear to it on the Bible! If
it's not true, let her deny it before me. There's
the challenge. You owe it to her as well as to me
to accept. At least give her the opportunity of
denying it, if you think you know her. But you
don't know women&mdash;you never have, and you never
will. I tell you you're living on a volcano. You've
no right to compromise her as you're doing now.
It's currish! At least I thought you had some
spark of chivalry in you! But you won't make
the test because you know I've spoken truth.
You're afraid. If you want to prove to yourself
she's the angel you think her, then make the test.
Ask her before me in any form of words you like.
Either that or take my word!"</p>

<p>"I'll not ask her that."</p>

<p>"Then at least come with me to see her, and
satisfy yourself indirectly that I've spoken the
truth when I tell you you're living on a volcano.
Play the game, Clifford, play the game!"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re took up his hat and stick.</p>

<p>"We'll go to see Miss Verney now," he answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Husband and wife drove together to the nursing
home to see Elaine. But a nurse informed them
decisively that Fraulein Verney could receive no
visitors; the excitement of the afternoon had been
too much for her slowly returning strength, and
Dr Hegelmann had ordered her absolute quietude.
To-morrow, perhaps, she might be allowed to
receive her friends&mdash;or perhaps the day after
to-morrow.</p>

<p>"I intend to call to-morrow morning," said Olive
to her husband.</p>

<p>"I too."</p>

<p>"Shall we say 10.30?"</p>

<p>"If you wish."</p>

<p>"Then call for me at the Quisisana at ten
o'clock.... In the meantime, I leave it to your
sense of honour not to communicate with Miss
Verney."</p>

<p>"Agreed."</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble to see me to my hotel.
I'll go back in the taxi."</p>

<p>It was a night of very troubled thought for all
three. To Rivi&egrave;re, with his complex, many-layered
nature, especially so. The one inevitable, clean-cut
solution to all this tangle of circumstance seemed
farther off than ever.</p>

<p>If Rivi&egrave;re had been a man of Larssen's temperament,
difficulties would have been smoothed away
like hills under the drive of a high-powered car.
Lars Larssen would have said to himself: "Which
woman do I want?" and having settled that
point, would have jammed on the levers and shot
his car straight forward without the slightest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
regard for any other vehicle or pedestrian on his
road. Were any obstacle in his path, so much the
worse for the obstacle.</p>

<p>If Larssen under similar circumstances had wanted
Elaine he would have taken her then and there
and left Olive to do whatever she pleased. If he
had wanted Olive, he would have thrown Elaine
in the discard without a moment's remorse. Decisions
are easy for such a man as Larssen, because
the burden of scruples has been pitched
aside.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re, on the other hand, was cursed with
scruples&mdash;as Olive had phrased it, "a pretty mixed
set of scruples." He felt he had to do the square
thing by his wife, by Elaine, and by the public
who were being called upon to invest their savings
under the guarantee of his name. He had to
smash the shipowner's scheme, and he had to
get back to his own scientific work in peace and
quietude.</p>

<p>For Olive, as for Larssen, decisions were far
simpler. Her objective was her own gratification;
the only point in doubt was the most prudent way
to attain it. Her present dominant wish was to
revenge herself on Elaine, and to do that she was
ready to make any sacrifice of other desires. Even
her infatuation for Larssen paled against the white-hot
light of this new passion.</p>

<p>Elaine, exhausted by the tension of her interview
with Olive, slept that night in a succession of heavy-dreamed
dozes punctuated by violent starts of
waking, like a train creeping into a London terminus
through an irregular detonation of fog-signals. Why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
had Rivi&egrave;re sent no answer to her message? What
had Olive said to him? Had she done the best
possible thing to free Rivi&egrave;re? That was the
never-ceasing anxiety. In her great love for him,
the one thing she most desired was to <i>give</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE PARTING</span></h2>


<p>At the breakfast-table the next morning,
Rivi&egrave;re found a letter with an official seal
awaiting him. It was a call to N&icirc;mes to
give evidence in the coming trial of the peasant
Crau. He was asked to be there on a date a few
days later.</p>

<p>Olive was already waiting for him in the palm-lounge
of the Quisisana when he reached there at
ten-o'clock. She was smilingly gracious&mdash;had seemingly
forgiven him his doubting of her word the
evening before. They took a taxi to the nursing
home, and on the way Olive stopped at a florist's to
buy a bunch of tiger-lilies. Her choice of flower
struck Rivi&egrave;re as very characteristic of her own
temperament.</p>

<p>They received permission to visit the patient,
and were shown to her room by a nurse.</p>

<p>"I have brought you a few flowers, dear," said Olive.</p>

<p>Elaine murmured some words of thanks and felt
the flowers to see what they might be. When she
recognized them, they conveyed to her the same
impression as they had done to Rivi&egrave;re. She drew
her vase of white lilac nearer to her, and that trifling
action seemed to Rivi&egrave;re as though she were calling
upon him for protection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've come to talk matters over calmly and
dispassionately," said Olive, taking the reins of
conversation into her own hands. "My husband
and myself are both anxious to make some arrangement
which will be for your happiness. Clifford
feels, and I entirely agree with him, that he's under
a distinct obligation to you."</p>

<p>"There is no obligation," answered Elaine.</p>

<p>"It's very generous of you to say so, but both
Clifford and I feel it deeply. Your livelihood has
been taken away from you, and it's our bare duty
to make you some form of compensation. The
suggestion of letting it come through me would
be a very suitable way of solving a delicate problem."
She turned to her husband. "Don't you think
so, Clifford?"</p>

<p>"I want to hear what Miss Verney has to say."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>Elaine paused before she replied, so that her
words might carry a fuller significance. "Mrs
Matheson," she said, "I don't wish to accept anything
from you."</p>

<p>"That means, I take it, that you are ready to
accept from my husband?"</p>

<p>"Accept what?"</p>

<p>"Well, financial assistance."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then what are you going to do when you leave
the home?"</p>

<p>"I shall return to my relations until I've learnt
a new trade and can manage to support myself."</p>

<p>"But surely you will let us help you with the
expenses of the first few months?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"I prefer not."</p>

<p>"Clifford, can't you persuade Miss Verney?"</p>

<p>"I don't wish to persuade her."</p>

<p>Olive tried a fresh avenue of attack. "Very
well, then, let's leave that point. What I want
to say now is still more delicate. I don't want to
wound your feelings, but now that all three of us
are together the matter ought to be discussed
calmly and dispassionately and settled once and
for all."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re interrupted. "You promised me that
this matter should not be mentioned."</p>

<p>"Promised?"</p>

<p>"In effect."</p>

<p>"But we <i>must</i> discuss it!"</p>

<p>Elaine put in a word: "I'd sooner the whole
situation were threshed out now. Please!"</p>

<p>"As you will," answered Rivi&egrave;re. "But remember
that you're perfectly free to close the
discussion at any moment."</p>

<p>Olive resumed: "Yesterday, when we had our
chat together, I was forced to draw certain inferences.
And I had to tell Clifford that it would
be only right for him to avoid compromising you
further."</p>

<p>"What inferences?"</p>

<p>"Must I speak more definitely?"</p>

<p>"I prefer plain speaking."</p>

<p>"Well, that people would begin to talk malicious
gossip about yourself and my husband."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re interrupted again. "This discussion is
an insult to Miss Verney."</p>

<p>But Elaine answered: "I prefer to thresh it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
out.... What people say matters nothing to
me. In any case, nobody knows that Mr Rivi&egrave;re
is your husband."</p>

<p>"But they will."</p>

<p>"You mean that you'll tell them?"</p>

<p>"It must come out."</p>

<p>"You mean that you want Mr Rivi&egrave;re to return
to you openly as your husband?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Then why did you tell me yesterday that you
had cut definitely loose from him? That you
never wanted to see him again? That he was free
to live out his life as John Rivi&egrave;re?"</p>

<p>"Why did you say that you had lived with
my husband at N&icirc;mes?" retorted Olive sharply.
"That you'd let the divorce suit go undefended?"</p>

<p>It thundered upon Rivi&egrave;re what Elaine had
done for him&mdash;how she had wrought her miracle&mdash;and
that moment cleared his mind of all doubt and
hesitancy.</p>

<p>"I've heard sufficient," he cut in.</p>

<p>"You've not heard all I've got to say!" pursued
Olive vindictively, and a torrent of words poured
out from her: "It was a pretty scheme your Miss
Verney had planned! She was to egg me on to
divorce you, so that she could get a clutch on your
feelings and marry you and your money! Your
money&mdash;that puts it in a nutshell! That's the
kind of woman a man like you falls in love with!
A woman who's too shrewd and too cunning to
commit herself. Who provokes and tantalizes and
lures on a man, and then stops him short at the
very last moment. The musical-comedy type. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
'mind the paint' girl. A hundred times worse
than the frankly vicious. A woman who knows
that a week of living with a man would sicken him
of her. Who's shrewd enough to tantalize him
into hand-and-feet marriage. That's your Miss
Verney. You're welcome to her as Miss Verney!
So long as I live, you'll never have her as your
wife! That's my last word&mdash;my absolute final
last word!"</p>

<p>Olive rose from her chair, quivering in every
limb, and swept out of the room.</p>

<p>Elaine bowed her head in the shame of those
bitter words.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re came to her side and kissed her hand
reverently.</p>

<p>"You did this for me. I understand all. Elaine,
dear, I understand it all. There's no need for you
to explain."</p>

<p>"You don't believe&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Not a word of it! You're the sweetest,
bravest&mdash;&mdash;" Words failed him, and he could
only take her hand tenderly in his and let his welter
of unspoken thoughts go silently to her.</p>

<p>"The things she said&mdash;you don't believe they're
true?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of them.... You've piled up a
debt on me more than I can ever repay. You've
freed my hands to fight down Larssen, but at what
a cost to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Then it's freed you?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. The divorce was Larssen's trump-card.
You've fought for me far better than I
could ever have fought for myself. To think of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
you lying there helpless, and yet battling for me!
My God, but at what a cost to yourself!"</p>

<p>"If it's freed you, dear John, nothing else
matters."</p>

<p>"It has. Now I can smash Larssen's scheme.... But
what of you, what of you?"</p>

<p>"We must part&mdash;now," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Why now?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to explain."</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re clenched his hand. "Yes, you're right,"
he said after a pause. "We must part&mdash;for a time."</p>

<p>"It will be best for both of us. You must go
back to your world."</p>

<p>"I'm wanted at N&icirc;mes a few days hence, to give
evidence at the trial."</p>

<p>"Then leave Wiesbaden to-day."</p>

<p>"Give me till to-morrow near you."</p>

<p>"No, you must go to-day.... We'll say good-bye
now."</p>

<p>She held out her hand, but he took her in his
arms and kissed her passionately.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;I'm a brute!"</p>

<p>"Dear John, go now. Don't stay. Go back
to your world and fight your battle. I shall recover
my sight&mdash;I feel that more strongly than ever.
I shall need it if only to read your letters. Go now,
and take with you my wishes for all happiness and
all success in your life-work!"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re tried to answer, but the words choked
in his throat.</p>

<p>"Elaine!" was all he could utter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That night he took train for Paris, to call on
Barr&egrave;ze the manager of the Od&eacute;on Theatre.</p>

<p>There he fixed up an arrangement by which
Barr&egrave;ze would send to Elaine, in the guise of payment
for the uncompleted work she had done for
him, a substantial sum of money. It was a temporary
expedient only, but it would serve Rivi&egrave;re's
purpose.</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to N&icirc;mes to attend the trial
of the youth Crau.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">HEIR TO A THRONE</span></h2>


<p>The liner "Claudia" was ripping her way
eastwards through a calm Atlantic, like
shears through an endless length of blue
muslin.</p>

<p>An unclouded morning sun beat full upon the
pale cheeks and delicate frame of Larssen's little
twelve-year-old son, alone with his father on their
private promenade deck. The contrast between
the broad frame of the shipowner and the delicate,
nervous, under-sized physique of his boy was
striking in its irony. Here was the strong man
carving out an empire for his descendants, and here
was his only son, the inheritor-to-be. Neither
physically nor mentally could Olaf ever be more
than the palest shadow of his father, and yet Larssen
was the only person who could not see this. He
was trying to train his boy to hold an empire as
though he were born to rule.</p>

<p>"How clever Mr Dean is!" Olaf was saying.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Look at the set of wheels he's rigged up for me
so as I can sail my boat on deck." He held up a
beautiful model yacht, perfect in line and rig, with
which he was playing. Underneath it was a crudely-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>made
contrivance of wood and wire, with four corks
for wheels&mdash;the handiwork of Arthur Dean.</p>

<p>"Was that your idea?" inquired Larssen.</p>

<p>"No, Dad.... Now, watch me sail her up to
windward."</p>

<p>"Wait. You ought to have thought out that
idea for yourself."</p>

<p>"I haven't any tools on board, Dad."</p>

<p>"Then go and make friends with the carpenter."
Larssen took up the crude contrivance and looked
it over contemptuously. "I want you to think
out a better device; pitch this overboard; then
find out where Mr Chips lives, make friends with
him, and get him to construct you a proper set of
wheels to your own design."</p>

<p>The boy looked troubled. "I don't want to
throw it overboard!" he protested. "I want to
sail my boat on deck now."</p>

<p>"Sonny, there are heaps of things that are good
for you to do which you won't want to do. It's
like being told by the doctor to take medicine. It's
nasty to take, but very good for you.... I want
to see you one day a big strong fellow able to handle
men and things&mdash;a great big strong fellow men
will be afraid of. That's to be your ambition.
You've got to learn to handle men and things.
Here's one way to do it."</p>

<p>"But Mr Dean wouldn't like it if he knew I'd
thrown his wheels overboard."</p>

<p>"Dean is a servant. He's paid to do things for
you. His feelings don't matter.... But you
needn't tell him you threw his wheels away. Say
they slipped over the side. Now, get a pencil and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
paper, and let me see you work out a better
contrivance."</p>

<p>Olaf obeyed, though reluctantly, and presently
he was deep amongst the problems of the inventor.
Lars Larssen watched the boy with a tenderness
that few would have given him credit for.</p>

<p>"I've got it! Look, Dad!" cried the boy
excitedly, and began to explain his idea and his
tangled drawing.</p>

<p>"Good! That's what I want from you. Now,
don't you feel better at having worked out the
idea all on your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad. I'll go to Mr Chips at once and get
it made. In which part of the ship does he live?"</p>

<p>"You must find that out yourself."</p>

<p>"How much shall I offer him?"</p>

<p>"Don't offer him anything. Make friends with
him, and he'll do it for you for nothing."</p>

<p>"But I always give people money to do things
for me."</p>

<p>"That's a bad habit. Drop it. Get things
done for you for nothing."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I want you to be a business man
when you grow up, and not merely a spender of
money."</p>

<p>"What does a business man mean exactly?"</p>

<p>"A ruler of men."</p>

<p>The boy looked troubled again. His confusion
of thoughts sorted themselves into his declaration:
"I don't want to be a ruler of men; I want people
to like me."</p>

<p>"That's a poor ambition."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Mostly anyone wants that. It's a sign of
weakness. Drop it."</p>

<p>"What ought I to want?"</p>

<p>"People to fear you."</p>

<p>"Why should they be afraid of me, Dad?"</p>

<p>"For one thing, because some day you'll have
all my money and all my power. Just how big that
is you can't realise yet. That's one reason. The
other reason must lie with yourself&mdash;you must
make yourself strong and afraid of nothing. How
many fights did you have this term, before you
got ill?"</p>

<p>"Only one."</p>

<p>It was clear from the boy's downcast eyes that
he had been beaten in his fight.</p>

<p>"That's bad. That's disobeying my orders.
Didn't I tell you to fight every boy in the school
until they acknowledged you master?"</p>

<p>"I'm not strong enough."</p>

<p>"You must make yourself strong enough. It's
not a question of muscle, but will-power. When
you're properly over this illness, I'll pick you out
a school in England with about thirty or forty
boys of your own age. They're soft, these English
boys, softer than Americans. I want you to lick
your way through them, and then I'll take you
back to the States to polish up on Americans."</p>

<p>After a pause came this question: "Dad, must
I have all your money when I grow up? Couldn't
some one else have some of it?"</p>

<p>"Sonny, don't look at it that way. You're
born to an empire; try and make yourself fit for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
it. I'm building it for you. It'll be a glorious
inheritance.... Now throw those wheels overboard,
and run along and find Mr Chips."</p>

<p>Presently Arthur Dean came to the private deck
to ask if Larssen had any orders for him. He was
acting as interim private secretary.</p>

<p>The shipowner dictated a few messages to be
sent by wireless, and then remarked:</p>

<p>"When you're back in London, I suppose you'll
be going to see your young lady as well as your
parents?"</p>

<p>Dean blushed.</p>

<p>"Taking her back any presents?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"A ring?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't doubt that'll come in its own
good time."</p>

<p>"You don't think I ought to&mdash;&mdash;?" began
Dean tentatively.</p>

<p>"I don't interfere in that. It's your own private
affair and no concern of mine. You can afford to
marry her on your present salary. If she's a girl
likely to make a good wife, I hope you <i>will</i> marry
her. I like my employees to be married. It's
healthy for them and makes them better business
men. Is she an ambitious girl?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know that."</p>

<p>"Well, my advice to you is this: marry someone
ambitious. You'll need it. You're inclined
to weaken."</p>

<p>"It's very good of you to take such an interest
in me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like you. I want to make you one of my
right-hand men eventually. Now I want to say
this in particular: keep business affairs to yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll certainly do so, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about them even to your parents, even
to your young lady. I'm paying you a very good
salary for a man of your age, and I expect a closed
mouth about my affairs."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Get the reason for it. This deal I'm engaged
on is a big thing, and there are plenty of City people
in London who'd like to know just what I'm planning,
and just why Matheson and I sent you to Canada.
I want you to keep them guessing until the scheme's
floated. D'you get that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir! You may rely on me not to
say anything about your business affairs to anybody.
I know how things leak around once anybody's
told."</p>

<p>"That's right! Now send off those wireless
messages, and then go and amuse yourself for the
rest of the morning. Cabin and all quite comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thank you, sir," answered Dean, and
went off buoyantly.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Olaf was sailing his yacht on
deck on the new set of wheels made for him by the
ship's carpenter, while his father sat stretched
in a long deck-chair watching him tenderly and
weaving dreams for his future. The thought
crossed his mind&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;whether
it wouldn't be advisable to get a stepmother for
the boy. Larssen had a strong intuitive feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
that he would not live to old age, and he wanted
to know that the boy would have someone to care
for him and to stand behind him while he was
seating himself firmly on his father's throne.</p>

<p>Specifically, the shipowner was reviewing Olive
as a possible stepmother. There was no scrap of
passion in his thoughts. He was viewing the
matter as a business proposition, weighing the pros
and cons calmly and cool-bloodedly. Would Olive
be the right stepmother for the boy? She was of
good family, with influential connections. She
made a fine presence as a hostess. Her ambition
was undoubted. Even the trifling point of the
similarity between Olive's name and that of his
boy impressed him, by some curious twist of mind,
as favourable.</p>

<p>"Dad, look at me!" called out Olaf. "I've
made some buoys, and now I'm going to sail her
round a racing course."</p>

<p>He had run needles through three corks, and
planted them in the pitch-seams of the deck to
form the three points of a large triangle, in imitation
of the buoys of a yacht-race course.</p>

<p>"This buoy is Sandy Hook, and this one is the
Fastnet, and that one over there is Gibraltar."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the shipowner. "I'll time the
race." He took out his watch. "Are you ready?... Go!"</p>

<p>When the course was completed and the yacht
lay at anchor again at Sandy Hook, Larssen called
his son to the seat at his side.</p>

<p>"Do you remember much of your mother?" he
asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy's face clouded over. "I don't know.
Sometimes I seem to see her very plainly, and sometimes
again I don't seem to see her at all when I try
to. Was mother very beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Very beautiful, to me," assented the shipowner.</p>

<p>"I think I should have loved her very much."</p>

<p>"How would you like to have a new mother?"</p>

<p>Olaf thought this over in silence for some time.</p>

<p>"It depends," he ventured at length.</p>

<p>"Depends on what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I must see her. Then I could
tell you."</p>

<p>"You care for the idea?"</p>

<p>"I must see her first."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right. Well, Sonny, as soon as
we're in London I'll take you to see her. But
remember this: don't breathe a word of it to anyone.
Keep a tight mouth. That's what a business
man has always got to learn."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because silence in the right place means big
money."</p>

<p>Olaf reflected over the new problem for some time.</p>

<p>"Dad," he said presently, "I'd like her to like
me very much. And I'd like her to be a good
sailor."</p>

<p>Larssen smiled at the na&iuml;ve requirement.</p>

<p>"Is that very important?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You see, I want her to live with us on
a yacht, and some women are so ill whenever they
go on board a boat."</p>

<p>"Which do you like best: the country, or a big
city, or the sea?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sea&mdash;the sea! I hate a big city. The
crowds of people make me feel...." He groped
about for a word which would express his feeling " ... make
me feel so lonely."</p>

<p>"You'll have to overcome that. One day your
work will lie in controlling crowds of people."</p>

<p>"Dad, let me stay on a yacht till I get quite well
again!"</p>

<p>Larssen considered for a moment. "Well, if it
will help you to get your fighting muscle, I'll arrange
it. There's a small cruising yacht of mine&mdash;the
'Starlight'&mdash;lying in Southampton Water. I might
have her cruise about the Channel for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dad, I'd like that immensely."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll see to that. We must go up to London
for a few days, and meanwhile I'll arrange to have
the 'Starlight' put in order for you."</p>

<p>"Can I be captain of the yacht?"</p>

<p>"That's the spirit I want! But you can't be
captain at a jump. You must work your way up.
First you'll have to work for your mate's ticket.
I'll tell the captain to put you through your paces&mdash;give
you your trick at the wheel and so on. But
see here, Sonny, it'll be work and not play. You'll
have to obey orders just as if you were a new
apprentice."</p>

<p>"I love the sea! I'll work right enough."</p>

<p>Larssen grew grave with memories. "Work?
You'll never know work as I knew it. At fourteen
I was a drudge on a Banks trawler. Kicked and
punched and fed on the leavings of the fo'castle.
Hands skinned raw with hauling on the dredge-ropes&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>A deck steward bearing a wireless telegram came
to interrupt them. The message was from Olive,
and it read:</p>

<p>"Important developments. Come to see me as
soon as you arrive."</p>

<p>Larssen scribbled an answer and handed it to
the steward for despatch.</p>

<p>The boy was thinking over the coming cruise
of the "Starlight." Suddenly he exclaimed: "I've
got an idea! Invite her on board my yacht!"</p>

<p>Larssen smiled. "That's a very practical test
for her!" he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE REINS HAD SLIPPED</span></h2>


<p>The Italian garden at Thornton Chase was
perfect in its artificiality. It sloped down
towards Richmond Park in a series of stately
terraces with box-hedge borders trimmed so evenly
that not a twig or leaf offended against the canons
of symmetry. They were groomed like a racehorse.
Centred in a square of barbered lawn was
a fountain where Neptune drove his chariot of
sea-horses. The Apollo Belvedere, the Capitoline
Venus, Minerva, and Flora had their niches against
a greenhouse of which the roof formed the terrace
above&mdash;a greenhouse where patrician exotics held
formal court.</p>

<p>Olive was feeding a calm-eyed Borzoi from the
tea-table when Larssen and his little boy arrived.
The pose was that of a Gainsborough portrait&mdash;she
had dressed the part as closely as modern dress
would allow. Sir Francis was leaning back in an
easy-chair with one leg crossed squarely over the
other knee, and in spite of country tweeds and
Homburg hat, he was somehow well within the
picture. But Lars Larssen, with his broad frame
and his masterful step, was markedly out of harmony
with that atmosphere of leisured artificiality.</p>

<p>A lesser man would have been conscious of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
incongruity&mdash;not so with Larssen. He forced his
personality on his environment. He made the
Italian garden seem out of place in his presence.
A sensitive would almost have felt the resentment
of the trimly correct hedges and shrubs and the
classic statues at being thrust out of the picture on
Larssen's arrival.</p>

<p>For some time the conversation progressed on
very ordinary tea-table lines. Olive made much
of the little boy&mdash;petted him, sent in for special
cakes to tempt him with, showered a host of questions
on him about school and games and hobbies. Sir
Francis exchanged views on weather, politics, and
the coming cricket season with his guest. The
latter subject mostly resolved itself into a monologue
on the part of the baronet, since cricket held no
more interest for Larssen than ninepins; but he
listened with polite attention while Sir Francis
expounded the chances of the Australian Team
(he had been to Lord's that morning to watch them
at preliminary practice), and his own pet theory
of how the googly ought to be bowled.</p>

<p>Then, having offered libation on the altars of
weather, politics, and cricket, the baronet felt himself
at liberty to touch on business matters.</p>

<p>"Have you heard when Clifford will be back?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Let me see. To-day's the 26th. I expect him
not later than May 3rd. Probably sooner."</p>

<p>"Everything going smooth?"</p>

<p>"Yes; fine. I'm glad we delayed the issue until
May. Canada's getting well in the public eye just
now. When the leaves spread out on the park-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>trees,
town-dwellers begin to remember that the
country grows crops. They recollect that there's
40 million acres of cropland in Canada&mdash;250 million
bushels of wheat to move. They awake to the
notion that the wheat will need transport to Europe.
Yes, early May is the time for our Hudson Bay
issue&mdash;Clifford was right in suggesting the postponement."</p>

<p>Olive caught the new drift of conversation between
her father and her guest, and turned to cut in.</p>

<p>"Olaf would like to see the aviary," she said to
her father. "Especially the new owl. It's so
amusing to look at in the daytime. Will you
take him round and show him everything?"</p>

<p>The boy jumped up gleefully, and Sir Francis
roused himself from his easy-chair to obey his
daughter's order. He had grown accustomed to
obeying&mdash;experience had shown him it was more
comfortable in the long run to do as she wished.</p>

<p>"Bring some cake along, and we'll feed the
birds," he said to the boy, and the two moved off
together to the aviary, which lay sheltered under
the south wall of the house.</p>

<p>When the two were out of earshot, Larssen turned
smilingly to Olive, and his tone was that of one who
finds himself at home again.</p>

<p>"It's good to be back," he said.</p>

<p>Olive did not smile welcome to him, as he expected.
There was an unlooked-for constraint in
her voice as she inquired: "Another cup?"</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>She took the cup from him.</p>

<p>"I've missed you," he added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've had a worrying time," began Olive as
she poured out tea and cream for him.</p>

<p>"Clifford?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es."</p>

<p>Larssen read through the slight hesitancy of her
answer. "That means the Verney girl, does
it?"</p>

<p>"I've seen her."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At Wiesbaden."</p>

<p>"What made you travel to there?"</p>

<p>"She wrote me a letter."</p>

<p>"Which roused your curiosity."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you satisfy yourself?"</p>

<p>"I satisfied myself that so far there's nothing
to take hold of between her and Clifford."</p>

<p>"If she managed to give you that impression, she
must be clever as well as attractive."</p>

<p>"I know I'm right.... Though of course
they're in love with one another. Both admit it."</p>

<p>Olive was ill at ease&mdash;a most unusual frame of
mind for her. Larssen guessed she had some
confession to make, and prepared himself for an
outwardly sympathetic attitude.</p>

<p>"No doubt she's got the hooks into Clifford
tight enough," he answered. "It'll be merely a
question of time. No cause for you to worry.
Wait quietly. Have them watched."</p>

<p>"I intend to do nothing of the kind!" said
Olive sharply.</p>

<p>Larssen at once adjusted himself to her mood.
"Well, that's as you please. The affair is yours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and not mine. I don't doubt you have good
reasons."</p>

<p>Olive played nervously with a spoon. "I've
decided to drop the matter."</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"Divorce."</p>

<p>Larssen had the sudden feeling that during his
absence in the States the reins had slipped from
his hands. He would have to play very warily
for their recovery.</p>

<p>"No doubt you're right," he answered tacitly,
inviting explanation.</p>

<p>"I want my husband back."</p>

<p>"Very natural."</p>

<p>"I want you to get him back for me."</p>

<p>"That's a large order. I don't know the circumstances
yet."</p>

<p>"There's nothing much to tell. I saw this Miss
Verney and I saw Clifford, and I've changed my
mind&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"What did she say to you."</p>

<p>"She tried to make me believe that she wanted
a divorce and would let the suit go undefended."</p>

<p>"Bluff?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You saw through it at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then what's made you switch?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I change my mind?" countered
Olive coldly.</p>

<p>Larssen summed her up now with pin-point
accuracy. Jealousy had worked this transformation.
She wanted her husband because the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
woman wanted him. And he, Larssen, was dependent
on Olive's whims! The flotation of his Hudson
Bay scheme hinging on her momentary fancies!</p>

<p>The fighting instinct surged up within him. He
could look for no help from Olive&mdash;it was to be a
single-handed battle with Clifford Matheson. Well,
he'd give no quarter to anyone&mdash;man or woman!</p>

<p>Aloud he said, with a perfect assumption of
resignation: "What do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I want you to suggest."</p>

<p>"I suppose Sir Francis knows all about everything?"</p>

<p>"No; I've told him nothing. He still believes
Clifford went to Canada."</p>

<p>"That simplifies matters."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I've got the glimmering of a plan. Let me
work out details before I put it before you for the
O.K.... As I see the problem, it's this. You
want Clifford to cut loose from Miss Verney. You
want him to return to you. You want me to use
that signature to my Hudson Bay prospectus to
induce him to return."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You're making a mistake."</p>

<p>"In what?"</p>

<p>"Never try to force a man's feelings in such a
matter. Get him to persuade himself. Let him
return of his own free will or not at all. Now my
plan, if it works out right, will do that."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the plan?"</p>

<p>"Give me time to get details settled. Is Clifford
in London?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know where he is."</p>

<p>"I suppose I could get his address through Miss
Verney?"</p>

<p>"No doubt."</p>

<p>"Where is she in Wiesbaden?"</p>

<p>"With Dr Hegelmann."</p>

<p>"Just one more question: are you a good sailor?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but why? What a curious question!"</p>

<p>Larssen smiled at her reassuringly. "You'll
have to trust me a little. Naturally I want my
Hudson Bay scheme to go through smoothly, and
if at the same time I can bring husband and wife
together, why, it'll be the best day's work done in
my life! It'll make me feel good all over!"</p>

<p>"Thanks; that's kind of you!" returned Olive,
thawed by the cordial ring of his words.</p>

<p>"No need for thanks&mdash;wait till I've worked the
<i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i> stunt.... What do you think
of my boy?"</p>

<p>"A dear little fellow! But he needs care."</p>

<p>"He looks weak now, but that's the after-effect
of the illness. He'll put on muscle presently.
He'll be a match for any boy of his age in six months'
time."</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Sure. Let's come and join them at the
aviary."</p>

<p>They rose and walked to the house, chatting of
impersonal matters, and nothing affecting the
Hudson Bay scheme passed between Larssen and
Olive or Sir Francis until the moment of leaving.</p>

<p>The baronet was at the door of the motor, seeing
his guests depart, when Larssen said in a low voice:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Important matter to see you about. Could you
come to the office?"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"To-night I'm due at the banquet to the
Australian Team."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you come on afterwards? I shall be
at the office till midnight. It's about the Hudson
Bay deal."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;I'll come about eleven."</p>

<p>"Right! I'll expect you."</p>

<p>As they drove home in the car, Larssen said to
his boy:</p>

<p>"Tell me your impressions."</p>

<p>"I think the garden is fine, and the birds are
bully little fellows."</p>

<p>"Mrs Matheson&mdash;do you like her?"</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;&mdash;Is she the lady you meant when
you said on board ship you were going to marry
someone?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what you think of her."</p>

<p>A troubled look came into Olaf's sensitive eyes.
"I don't like her very much, Dad."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't think she means what she says."</p>

<p>"You're mistaken. Mrs Matheson has taken a
great liking to you, and I want you to be very nice
to her. You must meet her again and get better
acquainted. Now see here, I'd like you to invite
her on your yacht. That's the big test, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>Olaf's eyes brightened at the mention of the
yacht. "Very well, Dad," he answered. "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
you want me to, of course, I'll try and be nice to
her."</p>

<p>"I'll send you down to Southampton Water with
Dean, and from the yacht I want you to write
a letter to Mrs Matheson. I'll give you the gist of
what to say, and you'll put it in your own words."</p>

<p>"Are you going to marry Mrs Matheson, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't like her after better acquaintance.
I promise you that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE NEW SCHEME</span></h2>


<p>Larssen had spoken part truth when he
told Olive over the tea-table that he had
the glimmering of a plan in his mind. But
its object was by no means what he had led her to
believe. It was a scheme of an audacity in keeping
with his previous impersonations of the "dead"
Clifford Matheson, and its single objective was the
attainment of his personal ambitions. Even his
own son was to be used to help in the gaining of
that one end.</p>

<p>The new scheme, in its essential, held the simplicity
of genius. He would, single-handed, float the
Hudson Bay company with Matheson's name at
the head of the prospectus, whether Matheson
assented or not.</p>

<p>The first move was to evade the spirit of his own
written compact: "Until May 3rd, I fix up nothing
with the underwriters." To get round this obstacle,
he decided on the audacious plan of underwriting
the entire issue <i>himself</i>. That is to say, he would
give an absolute guarantee that if any portion
of the five million pounds were not subscribed for
by the general public, he himself would pay cash
for and take up those shares. It was a huge risk.
In the ordinary course of business no single finance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
house in London, the world's financial centre,
would take on its shoulders the guaranteeing of
a five million pound issue. Lars Larssen proposed
to do it. In order to provide the requisite security,
he would have to mortgage his ships and his private
investments. He would be dicing with nine-tenths
of his entire fortune.</p>

<p>The second move was to prevent interference,
while the issue was being offered to the public,
from those who knew anything of the inner history
of the flotation&mdash;Matheson, Olive, Elaine, and
Dean. Arthur Dean could easily be kept out of
the way. Elaine would no doubt be still confined
to the surgical home at Wiesbaden. Matheson and
his wife were problems of much more difficulty.
In whatever part of Europe Matheson might be,
he would be certain to hear of the flotation. The
point was to delay his knowledge of it for two or
three days. After that, interference on his part
could not undo what had been done. "One cannot
unscramble an egg."</p>

<p>For the success of the first move, it was essential
to have the willing co-operation of Sir Francis.
Consequently Larssen was particularly cordial and
gracious to him that evening at the Leadenhall
Street offices, passing him compliments about his
business abilities, which found their mark unerringly.</p>

<p>Presently the shipowner got down to the crux of
the matter, taking out the draft prospectus from
the drawer in his desk and smoothing it out to show
the signature of Clifford Matheson.</p>

<p>"As you see, I sent it to Clifford to O.K.," he
said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Francis looked at the signature through his
pair of business eyeglasses, and nodded an official
confirmation.</p>

<p>Larssen continued: "There's no alteration
necessary&mdash;Clifford passes it as it stands. But
I've thought of one point which I reckon would add
very considerable weight in its appeal to the public."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"The underwriting. There are a few blank lines
here"&mdash;he turned over to a page of small type&mdash;"where
the details of the underwriting arrangements
were to be filled in. We were negotiating on a 4 per
cent. basis, you remember. On some of it we should
have had to offer an overriding commission of
another 1 per cent. Say 4&frac12; per cent. on the average&mdash;that's
&pound;225,000 on the round five million shares.
A big sum for the company to pay out!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can avoid it."</p>

<p>"We might cut it out altogether and state that
'No part of this issue has been underwritten.'
That sounds like confidence on our part."</p>

<p>Sir Francis shook his head emphatically. "It
might do in the States, but it won't do over here.
Our public wouldn't like it. It's not the thing."</p>

<p>Larssen knew this latter was an overwhelming
reason to the baronet's mind.</p>

<p>"Very well; pass that suggestion," said he.
"Here's a far better one. Suppose we could get
the underwriting done at 3 per cent. straight. That
would save the company &pound;75,000."</p>

<p>"What house would take it on at that?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> would."</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" exclaimed the amazed Sir Francis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" quietly replied the shipowner.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;!" The baronet paused in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the particular 'but'?"</p>

<p>"We&mdash;the company&mdash;would have to ask you for
the fullest security."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Security up to the whole five million pounds."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;But I don't quite see your reason for
the suggestion."</p>

<p>"My reason is just this," answered Larssen
earnestly. "I want that prospectus to breathe
out confidence in every line and every word. I want
the whole five millions taken up by the public, and
not left partly on the underwriters' shoulders. I
want to do everything I can to make the public
realise that they're being offered the squarest deal
that ever was. What better plan could you have
than getting the vendor&mdash;myself&mdash;to guarantee the
whole issue at a mere 3 per cent. cover? No financial
house of any standing would look at it for a trifle
of 3 per cent. But I stand in and take the whole
risk&mdash;the whole five million risk&mdash;and give you
securities on my ships that bears looking into with
a microscope."</p>

<p>Sir Francis gasped his admiration of the daring
offer.</p>

<p>"That's pluck!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say? Are you agreeable,
for one?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;certainly!"</p>

<p>"Then will you bring St Aubyn and Carleton-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>Wingate
here, and get their consent? Say to-morrow
morning?"</p>

<p>"That's very short notice."</p>

<p>"You can get them on the telephone. If they're
here to-morrow morning and consent&mdash;there ought
to be no difficulty about that&mdash;you three Directors
can sick the lawyers on to me at once and fix up
the security deeds in a day or so."</p>

<p>"You ought to have been born an Englishman!"
said the baronet admiringly.</p>

<p>"One point occurs to me. Let's keep this matter
close until the prospectus is actually launched. I
don't want any Stock Exchange 'wreckers!'
trying to stick a knife into my back. You know
some of their tricks?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;certainly!"</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd even mention it to your
daughter. Women&mdash;even the best of them&mdash;can't
help talking."</p>

<p>"Women are not meant for business," agreed the
baronet sententiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">LARSSEN'S APPEAL</span></h2>


<p>In pursuance of his second move, Larssen had
to see Miss Verney. To write to her would
probably be fruitless waste of time; and it
was emphatically not the kind of interview to
delegate to a subordinate. He had to seek her in
person.</p>

<p>It was curious to reflect that, in this tangle of
four lives, the balance of power had shifted successively
from one to the other. At first it was
with Matheson. A letter of his had brought the
shipowner hastening to Paris to see him. Later,
it was Larssen who sat still and Matheson who
hurried to find him. Later again, it was Olive
who held decision between the two men. And now
Elaine.</p>

<p>As soon as he had settled the underwriting affair
with Sir Francis and his two co-Directors, Larssen
went straight to Wiesbaden to the surgical home,
and had his card sent in to Elaine.</p>

<p>Elaine received him in the garden of the home,
under the soft shade of a spreading linden, where
she had been chatting with another patient. Near
by, a laburnum drooped in shower of gold over a
bush of delicate white guelder-rose as Zeus over
Dan&aelig;. Upon the wall of the home wistaria hung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
her pastel-shaded pendants of flower, like the notes
of some beautiful melody, sweet and sad, along the
giant staves of her stem. A Chopin could have
harmonized the melody, weaving in little trills and
silvery treble notes from the joy-song of the nesting
birds.</p>

<p>The bandages had been removed from the patient's
eyes, and she wore a pair of wide dark glasses side-curtained
from the light.</p>

<p>After a few conventional words of greeting and
inquiry, Larssen drew up a chair beside hers.
"You're wondering why I've called on you," he
began. "You're thinking that a stranger&mdash;and
a busy man at that&mdash;wouldn't have travelled to
Wiesbaden merely to inquire after you. You're
thinking that I want something."</p>

<p>"What is it you want from me?" asked Elaine
with frank directness.</p>

<p>"I want your help," returned Larssen with an
assumption of equal frankness.</p>

<p>"My help! For what?"</p>

<p>"For Matheson."</p>

<p>"And what is this help you want from me?"</p>

<p>"It's simple enough, but first let me spread out
the situation as I see it. If I'm wrong, you'll
correct me.... To begin with, Matheson is a
man of complex character and high ideals. The
latter have been snowed under in his business career.
He's like an Alpine peak. From the distance, it
looks cold and aloof, but underneath there's a carpet
of blue gentian waiting to spring out into blossom
when the sun melts off the snow-layer. I don't
pay idle compliments when I say that I haven't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
far to look for the sun that's melting off the
snow."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>Elaine remained silent, but Larssen's vivid
metaphor went home to her.</p>

<p>"I used to admire Matheson as a financier,"
pursued the shipowner. "Now I respect him as a
man. He's put up the fists to me over what he
believes to be his duty to the British public, and I
like him all the better for it."</p>

<p>"You threatened Mr Matheson that you would
have me dragged into a divorce court if he didn't
sign agreement to your prospectus."</p>

<p>It was a definite statement and not a question,
and from it Larssen judged that the financier had
told her everything from start to finish.</p>

<p>"I did, and there's where my mistake lay. One
mustn't threaten a man of Matheson's calibre.
Please understand this, Miss Verney, all question
of divorce is dead."</p>

<p>"It would make no difference to me."</p>

<p>"It was fine of you to say so to Mrs Matheson.
You've pluck."</p>

<p>"Then you've been talking matters over with
Mrs Matheson?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I want to arrive at a final settlement
for all of us."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"That's where I want your help. First let me
complete my lay-out of the situation.... Matheson
is a man of high ideals. But he tangled up his life
pretty badly on the night of March 14th, when he
tried to cut loose from his old career. It was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
mistake. We've both made mistakes, he and I.
The unfortunate part is that the consequences
don't fall on us. They fall on Mrs Matheson and
yourself. You note that I place Mrs Matheson
before yourself? That's deliberate."</p>

<p>Again he paused, but Elaine did not make any
comment. She guessed now what Larssen had
come to say to her, and a shiver of fear went through
her. Not fear of Larssen as a man, but as a spokesman
for Fate. In the deliberate unfolding of his
statement, there was the passionless gravity of Fate.</p>

<p>Guessing her thoughts, Larssen's voice deepened
as he continued: "I definitely place Mrs Matheson
before yourself. She is his wife. He married her
for better or worse. However mistaken he may
have been in his estimate of her, he must keep to
his promise of the altar-side. She is his wife. As
a man of honour, Matheson's first duty is to stand
by his wife. I don't want to wound your feelings,
believe me. But I have to say this: you must
realise Mrs Matheson's point of view."</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"Do you realise that she is eating her heart out
in loneliness?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know."</p>

<p>"I do know. I went to see her a couple of days
ago at Thornton Chase. The change in her these
last few weeks startled me. I deliberately say
this: you have, unknowingly, dealt her a blow
from which she will never recover. She is naturally
far from strong, and though I'm not a doctor, I
venture to make this prophecy: within three years,
Mrs Matheson will be dead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>A low cry of expostulation came from Elaine.</p>

<p>"It's an ugly, brutal fact," pursued Larssen,
pressing home his advantage to the fullest extent.
Now that he had probed for and reached the
raw nerve of feeling, he intended to keep it tight
gripped in the forceps of his words. "It's brutal,
but it's true. Unwittingly, you have shortened her
life."</p>

<p>"I've sent Mr Matheson away," faltered Elaine.</p>

<p>"I guessed that. But will he stay away from
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I doubt it."</p>

<p>"We've said good-bye!"</p>

<p>"But he writes to you?"</p>

<p>There was an answer in her silence.</p>

<p>"He writes to you. That means a great deal&mdash;a
very great deal."</p>

<p>"What do you want from me?" cried the
tortured girl.</p>

<p>"Reparation," was the grave answer.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"To Mrs Matheson&mdash;to his wife."</p>

<p>"What more can I do than I have done?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't your heart tell you?"</p>

<p>"I'm torn with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With love for him. I know. I know. I'm
asking from you the biggest sacrifice of all&mdash;for his
sake and for her sake. While she lives, give her
back what happiness you can," Larssen's voice
had lowered almost to a whisper.</p>

<p>"What more can I do than I have done?"</p>

<p>"Much more. Write to Matheson definitely and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
finally. Send him back to his wife. She is to
cruise on board the 'Starlight'&mdash;a yacht of mine&mdash;with
my little son. Send Matheson to meet
her on the yacht."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then they will come together again. I'm
certain of it. I've seen Mrs Matheson and read the
change in her feelings. She'll be a different woman
now.... Can you see to write?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;faintly."</p>

<p>"Then write to Matheson what your heart will
dictate to you," said Larssen gently.</p>

<p>Presently he resumed: "Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"At N&icirc;mes."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;the trial."</p>

<p>"It should be finished to-day."</p>

<p>"Then Matheson will probably be returning to
London to see me. There's no need for him to
hurry back. He could board the 'Starlight' at
Boulogne or any other port he might prefer."</p>

<p>"Isn't May 3rd the day that ends your agreement?"
asked Elaine.</p>

<p>"It is; but I'll extend that date." Larssen
took from his pockets a fountain-pen and a scrap
of paper and scribbled a few words on it, signing
his name underneath. "Suppose you enclose this
when you're writing to Matheson? It extends our
agreement until May 20th."</p>

<p>He passed the paper to her.</p>

<p>The power of the human word, of the human
voice&mdash;how limitless it is! Larssen, master of
word and voice, had Elaine convinced through and
through of his sincerity in the matter of reconciling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
husband and wife. He had appealed with unerring
judgment to her finest feelings, and she read her
own altruism into his words.</p>

<p>Larssen knew that his point was won, and long
experience had taught him to close an interview
as soon as he had carried conviction.</p>

<p>"I won't tire you any longer," he said, rising.
"I just want to say this: you're <i>big</i>. You're the
finer woman by far, but she is his wife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">ON BOARD THE "STARLIGHT"</span></h2>


<p>The trial at N&icirc;mes proved a wearisome,
sordid affair, and its result was a foregone
conclusion. If there had been some motive
of romantic jealousy on the part of the youth Crau,
a French jury might have returned a sentimental
verdict of acquittal. As it was, they found him
guilty, and the judge sentenced him to three years
penal servitude.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re was heartily glad when the trial was over.
It was now the end of April&mdash;close to the date of
May 3rd, when the truce between Larssen and
himself would expire. The shipowner would be
back in London, and no doubt would have heard
from Olive something of the changed situation.
Force of circumstance would make him readjust his
attitude, and he would probably be ready to offer
compromise.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re judged it advisable to return to England,
and there to wait for overtures on the part of Larssen.
He had taken ticket for London, and was preparing
for travel, when two letters reached him, from Olive
and Elaine.</p>

<p>The latter gave him a keen thrill of pleasure. It
was written by Elaine herself, and this was proof
indeed of the miracle of surgery wrought by Dr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Hegelmann. But its contents made him very
thoughtful. She was asking him to go back to his
wife. She was pointing out to him a path of duty
exceedingly hard to tread.</p>

<p>Olive's letter added further pressure on his
feelings. She was advised to try a sea-voyage for
her health, she told him; Larssen had placed his
yacht at her disposal; she begged her husband to
meet her at Boulogne and once more to give her
a chance to explain. It was an appeal utterly
different to the attitude she had taken at Wiesbaden&mdash;there
was now a sincerity in it which Rivi&egrave;re
could not mistake.</p>

<p>The enclosure in Elaine's letter did not surprise
him. If Larssen of his own accord offered to
extend the truce until May 20th, it must mean
that the shipowner was aware of his shaky position
and ready to suggest compromise.</p>

<p>The effect of those three communications on
Rivi&egrave;re's mind was what Larssen had so shrewdly
planned. Rivi&egrave;re wired to his wife that he would
meet her at Boulogne Harbour.</p>

<p>That evening he caught a Paris express with a
through P.L.M. carriage for Boulogne. At the
Gare de Lyon, in the early morning, they shunted
him round the slow and tedious Girdle Railway to
the Gare du Nord, clanked him on the boat train,
and sped him northwards again in a revigorated
burst of railway energy. North of Paris, a P.L.M.
carriage undergoes a marked change of character.
It deferentially subdues its nationality, and takes
on an Anglo-American aspect. Harris-tweeded
young men pitch golf-bags and ice-axes on the rack,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
and smoke bulldog pipes in its corridors with an
air of easy proprietorship. American spinsters,
scouring Europe in couples, order lunch in high-pitched
American without troubling to translate.
The few Frenchmen who find themselves
in the train have almost the apologetic air of
intruders.</p>

<p>While passing through the corridor of a second-class
carriage, Rivi&egrave;re happened on the tubby
little figure and rosy smiling countenance of Jimmy
Martin the journalist. Martin never forgot a face
or a name&mdash;it was part of his profession to make
an unlimited acquaintanceship with everyone who
might possibly "have a story to tell."</p>

<p>"Hail, sir!" said he cheerily. "You haven't
forgotten the little sermon I had to preach to you
on the infallibility of my owners, the <i>Europe
Chronicle</i>?"</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re shook hands cordially. "I remember
perfectly. You're going home on holiday, I
expect?"</p>

<p>"I'm going home for good, praise be. I've
sacked my owners. I told them that they were a
set of unmitigated liars, scoundrels and bloodsuckers,
and that I couldn't reconcile it with my conscience
to work for them any longer without a 20 per cent.
increase in pay. They demurred, and I promptly
sacked them&mdash;having in my pocket an offer from
a London paper. Thus we combine valour with
prudence&mdash;a mixture which is more colloquially
known as 'business.'"</p>

<p>"What's your new post?"</p>

<p>"Reporter for the <i>London Daily Truth</i>. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
you've a story to tell at any time, and want a platform
to speak from, 'phone me up."</p>

<p>"Thanks; I will."</p>

<p>"I've been turning my think-tank on to the
Hudson Bay Transport flotation. You certainly
had some inside information on that deal. Why
did it shut up with a snap, I ask myself. Who
banged the lid down?"</p>

<p>Martin's effort to pump information was very
transparent, but his infectious good humour made
it impossible to take offence.</p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re was a keen judge of men, and he felt
instinctive confidence in the honesty of the whimsical
little journalist. One could trust this man. There
was nobody within hearing along the corridor of
the railway carriage. Accordingly he answered:</p>

<p>"If you'll keep the information strictly to yourself
until I want publication, I'll tell you."</p>

<p>Martin sobered instantly. "Mr Rivi&egrave;re," said
he, "you can trust me absolutely. I play square."</p>

<p>"So I judge.... You ask me who banged the
lid down. I did."</p>

<p>"Phew! You must have landed Larssen a hefty
one on the solar plexus."</p>

<p>"The matter is not finally settled yet. It's just
possible that I might need the platform you offered
me. Then I'll talk further."</p>

<p>"Exclusive?" asked Martin, with the journalist
part of him on top.</p>

<p>"I can't promise that. It depends."</p>

<p>"Well, first call at any rate. We might get out
a special edition in front of the other fellows. We've
started a new evening paper at the <i>Daily Truth</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
office, and I'd like to secure a scoop for one of the
two.... My stars, if I could have seen the scrap
between you and Larssen! There must have been
some juicy copy in that!"</p>

<p>"No doubt," commented Rivi&egrave;re drily. "Well,
I'll say good-bye now."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, thanks for your promise. I'll look
forward to the next meeting. <i>Au revoir</i>, as they
say in this whisker-ridden country."</p>

<p>Boulogne harbour was crowded with grimy tramp
steamers, fishing boats, and a rabble of plebeian
harbour craft, but the yacht "Starlight" was not
in view. Rivi&egrave;re inquired at the office of the
harbour-master, and was informed that a telegram
promised the yacht's arrival by nightfall.</p>

<p>She arrived true to promise, and lay out beyond
the twin piers of the harbour-mouth in the quiet
of sunset of the evening of April 30th&mdash;a trim-lined,
quietly capable, three-masted craft. Larssen had
referred to her as a "small cruising yacht," but in
reality the "Starlight" was much more than that
casual description would convey. In addition to
her extensive sailing power, she had a set of marine
oil engines for use in light winds or special emergency,
and her cabins and saloons were roomy and comfortable.
She could carry a party of a dozen passengers
with comfort if there were need, and had four life-boats
as well as a shore dinghy. The kitchen
equipment was admirable. Altogether, a trim,
well-found yacht which might have voyaged round
the world without mishap.</p>

<p>The dinghy was sent off with the mate and a
couple of seamen, and entered the harbour to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
enquire for Rivi&egrave;re at the harbour-master's office,
according to arrangement.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, sir," said the mate.
"Mrs Matheson's compliments, and will you come
aboard?"</p>

<p>"Is Mr Larssen on the yacht?"</p>

<p>"No. Mrs Matheson, her maid, and Master
Olaf&mdash;that's all. We're giving the little chap a
training in seamanship.... Jim, take the
gentleman's luggage."</p>

<p>They rowed out to the "Starlight," lying trimly
at anchor like a capable, self-possessed hostess
awaiting the arrival of a week-end guest at a country-house.
Olive waved greeting to her husband as
he came near. By her side was Larssen's little son,
holding her hand. He might have almost been
posed there by the shipowner to inspire confidence
in the peaceful intentions of the yachting
cruise.</p>

<p>Olive thoroughly believed that Larssen's sole
object in placing the yacht at her disposal was to
reconcile husband and wife, and so indirectly to
smooth over the quarrel between himself and
Clifford. She had no suspicion that his real objective
was to get Matheson on the high seas, the only
region where he could not hear of the coming flotation
of the Hudson Bay Transport, Ltd. Larssen
had told her that she was free to order the yacht's
movements as she pleased&mdash;he merely suggested
in a perfectly casual way that a cruise to the
Norwegian fjords might prove enjoyable.</p>

<p>"It was good of you to come!" said Olive as her
husband mounted the gangway to the white-railed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
deck. There was unmistakable sincerity in her
greeting.</p>

<p>"I'm to be captain of the 'Starlight' as soon
as I get my skipper's ticket," confided the little boy
as he shook hands.</p>

<p>Matheson had made up his mind to carry out
Elaine's wish. He had come back to his wife;
and he was prepared to fall in with any plan that
she might propose. Accordingly, when she suggested
the alternatives of a cruise down the Channel
and up to the Hebrides, or a cruise to Norway, he
left the decision to her. She chose Norway.
Matheson, with the shipowner's agreement in his
pocket to extend their truce to May 20th, raised
no objection. There was ample time to be back
in England before that date.</p>

<p>Olive gave her orders to the captain. Before
weighing anchor, the latter sent on shore for further
provisions. At the same time he dispatched a
telegram to Larssen stating that they were bound
for Norway that evening.</p>

<p>A smooth deft dinner was served to Matheson
and his wife in the comfortable saloon as the yacht
weighed anchor, slung round to a light wind from
the south-east, and made gently towards the outer
edge of the Goodwins. Through the starboard
portholes Wimereux Plage twinkled gaily to them
from its string of lights on esplanade and summer
villas; Cap Grisnez flashed its calm white light of
guardianship; Calais town sent a message of
kindly greeting from the far distance; only the
Varne Sands whispered a wordless warning as they
swirled the waters above them and sent a flock of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
shivering wavelets to beat against the smooth hull
of the "Starlight."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On that night of April 30th, while Clifford
Matheson slept on board the yacht, the presses of
Fleet Street thundered off millions of newspapers
which bore on their financial page the impressive
prospectus of Hudson Bay Transport, Ltd. The
post bore off to every town and village in the United
Kingdom hundreds of thousands of copies of the
issue in its full legal detail.</p>

<p>Heading the prospectus were these names on the
Board of Directors:&mdash;</p>


<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Clifford Matheson, Esq. (Chairman).</li>
<li>The Right Hon. Lord St Aubyn, P.C., K.C.V.O.</li>
<li>Sir Francis Letchmere, Bart.</li>
<li>Gervase Lowndes Hawley Carleton-Wingate, Esq., M.P.</li>
<li>Lars Larssen, Esq. (Managing Director). To join the Board after allotment.</li></ul>



<p>The capital was divided into 5,000,000 Ordinary
&pound;1 Shares, and 4,000,000 Deferred Shares of 1s.
The latter were assigned to the vendor, Lars Larssen,
in payment for various considerations. He had
also underwritten the entire issue of Ordinary
Shares for a commission of 3 per cent. The lists for
subscription were to open on May 1st and close
at midday on May 3rd. The London and United
Kingdom Bank, in which Lord St. Aubyn was a
Director, was receiving subscriptions and carrying
out the routine of issuing allotment letters.</p>

<p>Such in essence was the prospectus of Hudson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Bay Transport, Ltd. It embodied every point that
Larssen aimed for. It was entirely legal, since
Matheson had O.K.'d a copy of the prospectus, and
the further agreement between the two men had
been technically evaded by the fact of Larssen
underwriting the entire issue himself.</p>

<p>By the time the "Starlight" reached Norway,
the subscription lists would be closed and Matheson
would be impotent to veto the issue. If he were
three days on the high seas between France and
Norway, Larssen would have gained the control of
Britain's wheat-supply.</p>

<p>And Matheson had no knowledge of the daring
game that his adversary was venturing. Not even
a suspicion of it. In his pocket was the shipowner's
agreement to extend their truce to May 20th. His
mind was at rest regarding the Hudson Bay Scheme.</p>

<p>His thoughts were now centred on Olive and the
strange <i>volte face</i> in her feelings towards him. The
change in her was scarcely understandable. Yet
it was entirely a normal outcome of her essential
character. Olive had never appreciated Clifford's
value to herself until that day at Wiesbaden when
she had realised his value to the woman who was
ready to sacrifice her reputation and her happiness
in order to free his hands. The torrent of bitter
words she had poured on Elaine was the reflex
action of that sudden realisation. It was born of
uncontrollable jealousy.</p>

<p>Now she wanted to win Clifford back. It was
not sufficient that he had returned to her side. She
wanted his regard, his esteem, his affection, his love.
She wanted a child by him to bind them together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
The tenderness with which she was looking after
Larssen's little son was an outward expression of
that inner hope. It was a prophecy of the future.
Olaf stood for what might be. If she should have
a child of her own, she felt convinced that Clifford
would remain with her.</p>

<p>Those feelings were now the focus of Olive's
thoughts. The sincerity of her greeting to Clifford
was not an assumed emotion. It was inner-real.
And yet it might not last for long. The effect of
her drug-taking was to make every momentary
feeling seem an eternal, ineradicable mainspring of
action. Her many moods were each at the moment
vitally important to her. They obsessed her.
The morphia had not only undermined her physical
health, but had made her mind the prey of every
passing emotion.</p>

<p>For his part, Matheson was trying to weigh up
the essential value of this sudden change in his
wife. He admitted the sincerity; he doubted the
permanency. He realised that she ardently desired
a child of her own&mdash;that was plain to read from
her attitude towards Larssen's son. But in the
past she had always been impatient with children,
and he questioned whether her present feeling
was more than transitory.</p>

<p>The morning of May 1st brought grey sky, grey
waters, and a tumbling sea. The yacht was beating
north-east, close-hauled, into a stiff breeze from
eastwards. No land was in sight&mdash;only a few
trawler sails and a squat, ugly tramp steamer
flinging a pennant of black smoke to westwards.
As the day wore on the wind rose steadily, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the afternoon the watch turned out to reef sails.
Matheson was an excellent sailor, and this tussle
with the elements exhilarated him. Olive, too,
was quite at home on board a yacht, and the two
marched the decks together in keen enjoyment of
the bite of the wind and the whip of the salt spray.</p>

<p>By nightfall the wind had increased to a half-gale
but the "Starlight" rode through the sea in splendid
defiance, sure of her staunchness and steady in her
purpose.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In this fight for the control of Britain's wheat-supply,
Larssen had played to the highest his
powers of intellect, his foresight, and his ruthless
determination. He had forced the signature of
Clifford Matheson to the draft prospectus, thus
sanctioning its issue. He had evaded by one
daring stroke the spirit of his own signed agreement.
He had most carefully and minutely arranged for
the flotation of the company at the time when
Matheson would be on the high seas and out of
touch with London news.</p>

<p>The "Starlight" was a well-found yacht, capable
of weathering any North Sea gale. She had oil-engines
to supplement her sailing power. She was
provisioned for a month. Rough weather would
not drive her back to harbour. She could fight
through any wind or sea to Norway. Nothing had
been overlooked to carry Larssen's scheme to
perfect success.</p>

<p>Save only the hand of Providence.... Fate....</p>

<p>For such a man as Lars Larssen there is no other
antagonist he need fear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>But Fate, with its little finger, can squeeze him
to nothingness.</p>

<p>Out in the North Sea, wallowing sullenly in the
trough of the waves, her masts gone by the board
and her deck awash, lay the derelict schooner
"Valkyrie" of Bergen. She would have been at
the bottom of the sea had it not been for her cargo
of Norway pine, keeping her painfully afloat against
her will. Fate, with its little finger, moved this
uncharted peril right in the track of the "Starlight,"
beating close-reefed through the buffeting waves
on the night of May 1st, while Larssen, in his London
home, satisfied that his plans had foreseen every
human eventuality, slept the easy sleep of the
successful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">INTERVENTION</span></h2>


<p>The "Starlight" struck the sodden derelict
shortly before midnight, with a crash that
jarred the yacht to her innermost fibres.</p>

<p>She struck it full abeam, like a motor-car smashing
in the dark into an unlighted farm-waggon
drawn across a country lane. Bows crumpled up;
bowsprit snapped away; foremast, loosed from
its stay, and forced back by the pressure of a half-gale
on the close-hauled foresail, carried over to
port in a tangle of rope and wire and canvas.</p>

<p>Thrown back on her haunches, the "Starlight"
gasped and shivered and began to settle by the
head from the rush of water into the forecastle.</p>

<p>"All on deck with lifebelts!"</p>

<p>A seaman rushed through the saloons, throwing
wide the cabin doors, and shouting the captain's
order.</p>

<p>Up above, men were ripping the canvas covers
off the life-boats, flinging oilskins and rugs and
provisions into them, slewing round the davits,
hauling on the fall-ropes&mdash;a furious medley of
energies.</p>

<p>Matheson rushed to his wife's cabin, helped her
on with some clothes, tied her lifebelt, wrapped a
rug around her, and hurried her on deck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"What have we hit?" he snapped at the captain.</p>

<p>"Derelict."</p>

<p>"How long d'you give her?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes at the outside!" flung back the
captain, and then into his megaphone: "Lower
away there with No. 4!"</p>

<p>Lifeboat No. 4 was the second boat on the port
side&mdash;the leeward side. No. 3 was buried under
the tangle of wreckage from the collapse of the
foremast, and therefore useless. The boat was
already in the water, with the mate and four seamen
aboard, when Matheson, who had hurried
below, came again on deck with Olaf in his arms.
Behind him panted the stewardess and Olive's
maid, terrified and clutching some worthless finery
of hers.</p>

<p>"Women and children to No. 4!" shouted the
captain.</p>

<p>"I won't go without you!" cried Olive to her
husband, clinging tight to him.</p>

<p>The captain wasted no precious moments on
argument. He thrust the stewardess and the
trembling maid before him, and stout arms bundled
them down to the plunging boat. Then he passed
down the little boy.</p>

<p>"Is there room for all of us?" cried Olive.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The mate cast off, and lifeboat No. 4 disappeared
into the black night.</p>

<p>"Haul on the main and mizzen sheets!" ordered
the captain, to bring the yacht round and get a
leeward launch for Nos. 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Presently the two crackling sails gybed over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
with a thud, and the "Starlight" lay on the starboard
tack, head down and filling rapidly.</p>

<p>"Hurry like hell!" shouted the captain.</p>

<p>Into No. 1, with the boatswain in charge and
four seamen, went Olive and her husband and the
cook; and into No. 2 crowded the carpenter, the
two stewards, and the rest of the crew. For the
captain was left the frail dinghy, slung from the
stern. True to the tradition of the sea, he had
refused a place in any of the lifeboats.</p>

<p>Lifeboat No. 2 got away first of the two. It was
being tossed dizzily amongst the inky combers
twenty yards distant, the men rowing feverishly to
get clear of the yacht before she sank and sucked
them under. But with No. 1 there was some
hitch. The boatswain had unshackled the fall-ropes
aft, and the boat slewed off with the jerk of
a heavy wave.</p>

<p>"Clear away there forward, blast you!"</p>

<p>Two seamen were tugging at the fall-block.
Something had fouled. The "Starlight" was rearing
head stern up; her shattered bows were already
under the waves; her life was now a matter of
seconds only.</p>

<p>"Cut the ropes, you blasted idiots!"</p>

<p>Before the two men could get their knives
through the tough rope, the "Starlight" reared
like a bucking mare and plunged to her grave,
dragging with her lifeboat No. 1 and its eight
occupants.</p>

<p>"Jump for it!" yelled the boatswain.</p>

<p>Matheson, one foot caught under a seat, was
dragged down and down until his heart hammered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
like a piston and his lungs were bursting with the
fierce effort to hold his breath.</p>

<p>To the drowning man there comes a moment
when he perforce gives up the fight and abandons
himself to the blessed peace of unconsciousness,
like a wanderer in a snowstorm lying down to rest.
That moment had come to Matheson, when suddenly
the half-severed rope that shackled the lifeboat to
the doomed yacht gave way, and with a mutinous
jerk the boat rushed itself to the surface, bottom
upwards, flinging Matheson clear.</p>

<p>His craving lungs opened to the free air; he lay
back on his cork-jacket gulping it in greedily as the
whirlpool formed by the sinking yacht carried him
round and round in dizzy circles.</p>

<p>The moments of recuperation past, his first
thought was for his wife. He caught sight of a
shapeless something at the further side of the
whirlpool, and with all his strength beat round
towards it. It was Olive, clinging to an oar.</p>

<p>He reached her; shouted some words of hope
above the roar of the wind; searched around the
blackness of the night for a place of safety. Thirty
yards away, tossed upwards on a giant wave as
though in signal to them, there showed for a brief
moment the silhouette of an upturned boat, with
two men clinging to it.</p>

<p>"Our boat&mdash;over there!" he cried to Olive, and
clutching her by the arm, fought the combers
towards the hope of refuge.</p>

<p>Straddled across the upturned lifeboat were
the boatswain and a seaman. The others had
disappeared. On such a night it was impos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>sible
to rescue them unless by the accident of
chance.</p>

<p>Matheson, buffeted and blinded by the thrash of
the waves, just managed to drag Olive to the boat's
side. The boatswain, Fraser by name, lent him a
hand while he recuperated sufficiently to hoist
Olive across the keel of the storm-tossed boat.</p>

<p>"Where are the other boats?" he asked of
Fraser, when he had recovered speech.</p>

<p>The boatswain made a gesture of helplessness.
In that inky night, who could say where lifeboats
No. 2 and 4 might be?</p>

<p>Presently a rocket flung a rain of white stars
across the black curtain of the sky. It must be
from one of their own boats. But it was far away
across the waters. They shouted with all their
might. The wind hurled their words away in
disdain of the puny effort.</p>

<p>Matheson had pocketed a flask of brandy when
the call of all hands on deck had sent him tumbling
out of his berth. He now poured some of the
spirit down Olive's throat, and passed the flask
on to the men.</p>

<p>"Be sparing with it," he warned.</p>

<p>Then he set to work to make his moaning wife as
comfortable as the terrible circumstances of their
plight would permit. He took off his coat and got
her into it, binding her cork jacket around. A rope
was trailing from the stern and he secured this
and tied it round her waist, giving one end to Fraser
to hold and keeping tight hold of the other himself.</p>

<p>Very little was said as the endless hours of the
night dragged their leaden length to a sullen dawn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give me the morphia!" Olive had moaned at
intervals, in a delirium of fever.</p>

<p>The seaman, who had been the man on watch
when the "Starlight" struck the unlighted derelict,
had cursed intermittently at the cause of the disaster.
"Why didn't they show a blasted light?" he kept
on repeating with obstinate illogicality. "Why
didn't the fools show a blasted light?"</p>

<p>"Old man Larssen will give you hell when we
get to shore."</p>

<p>Olive, in her delirium, caught at the words. "I
can see the shore!" she cried. "Over there&mdash;over
there! Why don't you row? You want to
kill me first!"</p>

<p>Matheson tried to soothe her.</p>

<p>"We'll soon be on shore. A boat will pick us
up at daybreak."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they show a blasted light?" cursed
the seaman.</p>

<p>The sullen dawn uncurtained a waste of slag-coloured,
heaving waters. The gale had spent its
sudden fury, as though its work were now accomplished,
but the sky was grey and inhospitable.
Matheson raised himself on his knees on the keel
of the boat again and again to search around, but
no sail or steamer-smoke gave hope of rescue.</p>

<p>It was not until ten o'clock that a trawler came
within distance of seeing them, but apparently
their signals of distress were not noticed, for the
fishing vessel passed on to its work and disappeared
over the horizon.</p>

<p>A few fitful gleams of sunlight mocked their
shiverings with promise of warmth&mdash;promise un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>fulfilled.
Their brandy was now exhausted, and
some ship's biscuits in the boatswain's pocket were
sodden and uneatable. Thirst began to add to
the horrors of the situation. Olive was moaning
for water, and they had none to give her.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far advanced before a Copenhagen-Hull
packet ran across them, taking on
board three exhausted men and a woman in
delirium.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI
<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">FINALITY</span></h2>


<p>At Hull, prepared by wireless, doctors and
nurses were waiting for Olive when the
vessel reached port late at night. As
Matheson hurried with the ambulance along the
quayside, a tubby little figure of a man came up
to him.</p>

<p>"You remember me&mdash;Martin?" he asked. "I'm
covering this story for the <i>Daily Truth</i>."</p>

<p>"Come with me," answered Matheson. "I'll
give you the information you want presently."</p>

<p>He had first to see Olive safely in hospital. It
was all that he could do for her. Then he returned
to the journalist.</p>

<p>"I suppose that you know that the other two
boats were picked up early this morning?" said
Martin.</p>

<p>"Good! and Larssen's little boy?"</p>

<p>"Quite sound. I made a special interview
with him.... By the way, you know that
the Hudson Bay flotation is going strong on the
wing?"</p>

<p>He held out a newspaper folded back to the
financial page. A few moments' glance was sufficient
to tell Matheson all that he needed to know&mdash;that
the issue had been launched in his name on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the night of April 30th; that to-morrow at twelve
o'clock the lists were to be closed.</p>

<p>If he were to act at all, he must act now&mdash;<i>at
once</i>. His jaw squared and his mouth tightened
as he thought out the situation.</p>

<p>Then to the journalist: "We've got to smash
this&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>From the wallet in his breast-pocket Matheson
took out Larssen's two agreements&mdash;blurred with
sea-water, but now dried and fit for his purpose.
He handed the agreements to Martin, who whistled
surprise as he read them.</p>

<p>"He's underwritten it himself," was the latter's
comment.</p>

<p>"Yes. That evades his agreement with me.... What's
the price of a full-page advertisement
in your paper?"</p>

<p>"First, what's the idea?" returned the journalist.</p>

<p>Matheson led the way to a hotel near at hand,
and on a sheet of hotel note-paper wrote these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The use of my name on the Hudson Bay prospectus
is absolutely unauthorized. I earnestly
advise all investors to cancel their applications by
wire&mdash;at once.</p>

<p>(Signed) "<span class="smcap">Clifford Matheson</span>"</p></div>

<p>"I want that on a full page," he said decisively.</p>

<p>The journalist read the words, and then looked
up suspiciously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew you as a Mr John Rivi&egrave;re," he objected.</p>

<p>"I know, but I'm Clifford Matheson. I'll prove
it to you. I'll bring you the two survivors from
the 'Starlight' to testify."</p>

<p>"That's not much evidence."</p>

<p>"In town I could take you to my bankers, but
to-night it's impossible. Martin, you've <i>got</i> to
believe me! Hear what those two men have to
say!"</p>

<p>The journalist considered the matter in sober
silence.</p>

<p>"An advertisement like this is sheer libel," he
answered presently. "Larssen could rook you
for goodness knows what damages if you got it
published."</p>

<p>"I know. That goes."</p>

<p>"But my owners wouldn't stand for the damages.
They'd be equally liable, you know."</p>

<p>"I'll guarantee them up to my last shilling.
Get your editor on the trunk wire, and find out how
much guarantee he'll want me to put up."</p>

<p>Martin looked at him half in admiration and half
in doubtfulness.</p>

<p>"It would be a tremendous risk for me to take!"</p>

<p>Matheson looked him square in the eye.</p>

<p>"If you want a scoop that will make your career,"
he answered slowly, "it's here. Waiting for you
to pick it up. I promised you first call on my
news&mdash;here it is. Have you the pluck to take
your opportunity?"</p>

<p>"Exclusive?" asked Martin, the magic word
"scoop" setting him aflame.</p>

<p>"Exclusive," agreed Matheson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll prove to me that you're Clifford
Matheson right enough?"</p>

<p>"Within half an hour. And give you a full
interview, explaining my reasons for the announcement."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm on!"</p>

<p>Martin had a well-deserved newspaper reputation
for accuracy and good judgment. On his urgent
recommendation, therefore, the managing editor
of the <i>Daily Truth</i> consented to run Clifford
Matheson's full-page advertisement and to insert
the interview, contingent on his depositing with
Martin a cheque for &pound;250,000 to indemnify the
paper against a possible libel action on the part
of Lars Larssen.</p>

<p>Matheson also prepared letters to Sir Francis
Letchmere, Lord St Aubyn, and Carleton-Wingate,
giving a statement of his reasons for the announcement
in the <i>Daily Truth</i> of the next morning,
and asking them to send telegrams to all those who
had made applications for shares. The telegram
to be sent out was worded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I strongly advise all investors to cancel by
wire their applications for shares in Hudson Bay
Transport. See explanation in Daily Truth of
May 3rd.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clifford Matheson</span>."</p>

<p>Martin, who was leaving for London by a midnight
train, took charge of the three letters and
promised to have them safely delivered to the three
Directors of the company early in the morning.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two days later, Matheson had to leave his wife
in the hands of the doctors in order to attend a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
brief meeting of the Board of Directors of Hudson
Bay Transport, Ltd.</p>

<p>They were seated in the stately board-room of
the London and United Kingdom Bank in Lombard
Street, at one end of the huge oval table over which
the affairs of nations are settled. Clifford Matheson
was in the chair.</p>

<p>The routine business of the meeting had been
cleared when a clerk announced that Mr Larssen
wished to enter. Until the allotments had been
made by the other four Directors, he had no legal
right to sit at the board of the company or to take
part in any discussion. He now asked formal
permission to enter, and the Directors formally
agreed to receive him.</p>

<p>If they thought to find in Lars Larssen a beaten
man, they were greatly mistaken. He came in
with his usual masterful stride, and his eyes met
theirs surely and squarely.</p>

<p>"I've come to hear what's been fixed between
you," he said, and took a seat at the table.</p>

<p>Matheson took up a paper from the bundle before
him on the table, and replied with studied formality:
"The applications for shares totalled &pound;6,714,000
in round figures. Of these, all but &pound;8200 were
cancelled by telegram or letter on the morning of
May 3rd."</p>

<p>"As a consequence of your advertisement in
the newspaper?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The Board decided to proceed to allotment,
and we have accordingly allotted the applications
for 8200 shares. The remainder of the
5,000,000 ordinary shares will have to be taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
up and paid for by yourself under the terms of
your underwriting agreement."</p>

<p>"I expected that. I'm ready to carry out my
bond."</p>

<p>"As you will see," continued Matheson with the
same studied formality cloaking the irony of his
words, "you gain control."</p>

<p>Larssen smiled tolerantly. "That's turned the
trick right enough, but don't flatter yourself that
<i>you</i> did it. If it hadn't been for a sheer accident
that no man alive could foresee or prevent, I'd
have won hands down. I haven't been beaten by
<i>you</i>, and so I don't bear grudge. And I've no
intention of bringing a libel action to gratify your
longing for the limelight. I'll just sit tight and
let the Hudson Bay scheme flatten out to nothing."</p>

<p>He flicked thumb and forefinger together contemptuously.
"That Hudson Bay scheme was
chicken-feed. I've bigger than that up my sleeve.
What you've done won't put the stopper on me.
Let me tell you, Matheson, that it will take a better
man than you to down Lars Larssen."</p>

<p>When he left the board-room, all four Directors
remained silent. They knew that he had spoken
truth. Even in defeat Lars Larssen was a bigger
man than any of the four.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From the first, the doctors had little hope of
saving Olive. Her constitution, never a strong
one, had been undermined by the luxurious pleasure-seeking
of her life and the deadly nerve-poison
of the morphia. That night and day on the upturned
boat&mdash;drenched with the waves, chilled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
famished, tortured with thirst&mdash;had been an ordeal
to shatter even a woman with big reserves of strength,
and Olive had no such reserves.</p>

<p>When Matheson and his father-in-law hurried
back to Hull, it was to find that life was slowly
ebbing. Towards the end her mind cleared of
delirium, and she spoke rationally.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is all for the best, Clifford," she
murmured. "You came back to me, but could I
have held you?"</p>

<p>"You had come to care for me again," he
answered gently.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am so uncertain. It's my nature.
I might have held you for a little while ... and
then."</p>

<p>"You must think only of getting well again,"
he urged.</p>

<p>"Don't try to buoy me up with false hopes. It
is kind of you, dear; but I see things clearly now.... You
came back to me, and I am content. I
want rest now&mdash;just rest."</p>

<p>Presently her eyelids closed in sleep. Matheson
sat watching by her bedside for a long while, holding
her hand. She stirred once and murmured drowsily,
"You came back to me." And in her sleep she
passed away so gradually that none could say when
mortal life had ended and the life eternal had
begun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="EPILOGUE" id="EPILOGUE"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>


<p>In the spring of the following year, Clifford and
Elaine were on their wedding journey to Italy.
He had rented a sea-coast villa on the Ligurian
Riviera, and they were travelling to there from
Paris.</p>

<p>It was late at night when the Rome express set
them down at their destination. The sea was
booming eerily against the rock-wall of the tiny
harbour of Santa Margherita, crowded with lateen-sailed
fishing craft silhouetted as a tangle of masts
and ropes.</p>

<p>But the morning showed a cloudless sky and
sunshine dancing on the blue waters of the Gulf of
Tigullio. They walked together to the tiny fishing
village of Portofino, along the most beautiful
road in Italy. To the one side the azure sea was
lapping to their feet soft messages of welcome,
and to the other the olives and the pastel pines were
crowding down the hillsides to wish them joy and
happiness.</p>

<p>They climbed together through a grey-green
veil of olive-orchards, past the little white Noah's
Ark houses of the olive farmers and their quaint little
Noah's ark cypresses, to the full height of Portofino
Kulm, where the whole enchanted coast-line of the
Riviera from Genoa to Sestri Levante lay spread
out as a jewelled fringe of ocean. Elaine stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
hatless while the wanton breeze caressed her
glorious hair and caught at her skirts with careless
familiarity.</p>

<p>She threw her arms wide as she cried joyously
to Clifford: "Just to be able to <i>see</i> all this!"</p>

<p>"Thanks to Dr Hegelmann."</p>

<p>"I'm glad your work is for science. Some day
you'll be able to give to others in return for what
science has given to me."</p>

<p>"Indeed I hope so."</p>

<p>"For a month I claim you for myself," continued
Elaine. "You and I alone.... Then I'll share
you with your work&mdash;your big work. You and I
and your work!"</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
